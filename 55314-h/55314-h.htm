    <p class="sp0">"She looketh well to the ways of her <i>Household</i>, and eateth not the bread
    of idleness. Her children arise up, and call her blessed: her husband also, and he praiseth her.
    Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all."&mdash;<span
    class="sc">Proverbs</span>, Chap. xxxi., vs. 27, 28, &amp; 29.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">I have</span> taken so much pains to make the following work deserving of the
  title it bears, that I could not, without affectation, pretend to undervalue my own performance,
  by anticipating doubts of its utility, or by expressing any fear lest my friends should be
  disappointed when they look into it. Every publication of this description is necessarily
  calculated to be of some essential service; for it must not only be practical in its descriptions
  and directions, but must relate to matters touching the daily and hourly wants of all mankind; and
  it will, of course, be approved according as it may happen to meet those wants.</p>

  <p>As a mere Cookery-book, mine must submit to be placed in a lower rank than some others, because
  I do not profess to bring to light discoveries in the culinary art, neither do I design to favour
  epicurism. I have no pretension beyond that of advising young ladies who are their own
  housekeepers; and the receipts which will be found in my selection, are such as appeared to me
  suitable to any family of moderate style in living, and such as may be easily comprehended and put
  in practice. These have been carefully <span class="pagenum" id="pageiv">{iv}</span>revised and
  amended in the present edition, and some others added.</p>

  <p>While I am offering advice with respect to the manner of conducting domestic affairs, I cannot
  refrain from expressing my regret that so large a proportion of the young ladies of England are
  sadly deficient in that information, and in those practices of economy which are the most
  essentially necessary to their welfare as persons of influence and authority in a house. I am by
  no means singular in lamenting that the advantages of a knowledge of housekeeping seem to be so
  entirely lost sight of by those who have the responsibility of bringing up either their own or
  other people's daughters; and I find it frequently the subject of remark that the ladies of the
  present day have become incapable of being so skilful in the discharge of their domestic duties as
  the ladies of a former period were, in proportion as they have become more cultivated and more
  accomplished. But is it so? Are there now a greater proportion of women whose minds are really
  cultivated than there were formerly? Is there not rather a greater pretence of learning with less
  of it in reality? It is erroneous to suppose that persons of real learning look upon the minor
  duties of life with contempt, because of their learning; for, though learning does not, perhaps,
  give sense, it surely does not destroy it, and there is not only a want of sense, but a positive
  folly, in that affectation of refinement, and that assumption of superiority, which has led to the
  result now complained of. But the system of education which has prevailed of late years is
  certainly in fault; a system which assigns the same species of learning, indiscriminately, to
  young persons of every rank and degree, without distinction even as to ability. Such a method of
  bringing up has unavoidably been productive of very injurious effects; for, while it withdraws the
  daughters of farmers and tradespeople, and others, during a great part of their youth, from the
  practice of those homely arts which belong to their <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagev">{v}</span>stations, it leaves them, in nine cases out of ten, without anything more
  than the mere fancy that they possess acquirements of a higher order.</p>

  <p>The desire which many persons feel to give their children a better education than has been
  bestowed upon themselves is laudable, because it proceeds from sincere affection: but how often is
  the success equal to the motive which actuates? How often is the manner of attempting at all
  calculated for attaining the object so earnestly sought? An ambition to promote the welfare of
  children reconciles parents to part with them at that tender age when they ought to command more
  constant care than they generally need at a more advanced time of life; and this ambition is so
  strong that it will even cause little girls to be consigned to the blighting atmosphere of a
  crowded schoolroom, there to bewail the loss of the warm hearth, or the airy room of their own
  homes, and all the comforts which depend upon a mother's solicitude. With a view to their being
  educated, that is to say, fitted for the world, and for the discharge of their respective duties
  in it, girls are sent to school, and are there condemned to a dull course of lessons, before their
  minds have sufficient strength to imbibe any kind of learning that requires mental labour, and
  before their understandings are equal to any greater exertion than that of perceiving the
  difference between a roasted apple and a sugar-plum.</p>

  <p>A knowledge of housekeeping is not difficult to attain. It needs no natural superiority of
  talent, and no painful application. It is rather a habit than a science, and, like the neatness so
  characteristic of English women, this knowledge rarely comes to perfection at all, unless it be
  partly formed in early life, and by means of our very earliest associations. Little girls are
  always prone to imitate the ways of older persons, particularly in housekeeping matters. They very
  soon begin to find amusement in learning to make preserves, pastry, and such things. Those
  children, therefore, who are brought up at home, <span class="pagenum" id="pagevi">{vi}</span>and
  have the daily and hourly practice of domestic duties before their eyes, will naturally fall into
  habits of usefulness, and acquire, by degrees and imperceptibly, a knowledge of what belongs to
  home, which should constitute the elementary education of every woman who is not born to rank and
  to luxury. But the unhappy little creatures who drag through seven or more years of continuous
  monotony within the walls of a school, their minds taking little or no part in the tasks which
  their memories are racked upon, have but little chance of learning any thing which will benefit
  their after lives; for, those whose mothers knead the bread, churn the butter, and help to cook
  the dinner, have not the benefit of that sort of society that would teach them to apply their
  learning, that would call forth their acquirements, or that would be able to appreciate those
  acquirements when displayed. During the period which these children spend at school, their mother
  continues her old-fashioned occupations, and, as time passes on, she looks forward, perhaps, with
  cheering anticipations to the <i>help</i> which her daughters are to afford her. But alas! how
  often do these daughters return from school with false notions of the lives they are to lead, and
  with mistaken ideas of their own consequence, such as lead them to despise the humble occupations
  of their home, although their "education" may not have given them one single idea to justify any
  pretension of the kind. It is generally acknowledged, that girls educated at schools are seldom
  far advanced in learning. Where history and geography, and other sciences, are learnt by rote, "a
  page of Greece on Monday," a "page of Rome on Tuesday," a "page of Universal Biography on
  Wednesday," with occasional readings of the middle ages, of modern times, and application being
  made to maps, globes, charts, &amp;c., to fill up the time which is not devoted to the fine arts
  (for it all goes on at once), the stock of real solid information which is gained by the end of
  the year, will be very scanty, or will probably <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagevii">{vii}</span>have resolved itself into such a confused mass of imperfect information
  that all practical benefit may be despaired of. No wonder, if, after having undergone a course
  like this, a young girl is often found to have gained less from books than others have gained from
  vulgar report, and be puzzled to say whether it was Scipio or Washington who was the first
  President of the United States of America. They learn lessons, but they do not reason or think
  about what they are getting by heart; and many girls, whose education has cost a large sum of
  money, are unable to answer a question of name, place, or date, in their geography or history,
  without first running over a certain portion of one whole lesson, the sound of which has left a
  deeper impression on the ear, than its sense has left on the understanding. Just as, when wanting
  to ascertain the number of days in a particular month, we repeat the words, "Thirty days hath
  September," &amp;c., thus recalling by means of the jingle of words, what of itself had slipped
  our memories.</p>

  <p>Girls so educated are very much to be commiserated. They live, through that part of their lives
  in which the mind is most open to receive impressions, without any opportunity for exercising
  their powers of observation, till, at last, those powers fall into a state of inertness; and their
  education is finished without their having gained the least knowledge of what the world really is,
  or of the part which they are to be called upon to act in it. Having had no intimate association
  with persons really well informed, it is no matter of surprise, if they become conceited of their
  supposed attainments, or if they remain in ignorance of the fact, that a little music, a little
  drawing, and a very little French and Italian, are not sufficient to make an accomplished woman,
  and that merely going the round of primers will not, of itself, constitute what is looked for in a
  "good education." Nor is it, indeed, to be wondered at, if the home, which has been so cherished
  in recollection from one holiday time to another, fail to realise all the anticipations <span
  class="pagenum" id="pageviii">{viii}</span>of pleasure and of happiness which the thought of it
  has excited. Its simple occupations are not of a kind to make them, as novelties, attractive to
  one who is <i>only</i> a fine lady; the want of capacity to fill domestic duties will, of course,
  render them rather disagreeable than otherwise; and it is but natural that young women who, during
  all the early part of their lives, have been unaccustomed to think of household cares, should
  entertain some degree of aversion to them, and feel dissatisfied when called upon to take a part
  in them. Many a father has repented that he did not rather lay up for his daughter, the money
  which has been expended to no better purpose than to cause her to repine at the condition in life
  in which he must leave her. And many a mother's pride, in the fancied superiority of her daughter,
  has been saddened by the recollection, not only that her daughter was incapable of helping her,
  but that the time must come when that incompetent daughter would be left to take care of
  herself.</p>

  <p>My readers may imagine that I forget my proper theme: they may wish me to remember that this
  book professes only to aid those young ladies who are uninformed on this subject, <i>how to keep
  house</i>, and that I am diverging from that subject, and raising objections to a very common way
  of bringing up children. But when it is generally acknowledged that there is, in the ladies of the
  present day, a great want of skill as regards the affairs of their household, an ignorance, in
  fact, of some of their first duties, it cannot be impertinent for me to inquire, whether this want
  of skill, and this ignorance, be not properly ascribable to a defective, or even to a mischievous,
  course of education. I certainly do think that habits of usefulness, and the cultivation of
  talents, may be combined, but then the acquiring of the useful, and the cultivating of the finer
  accomplishments must proceed hand in hand. There are, doubtless, many who do not think it beneath
  them to be able to make a pudding, merely because they can execute a difficult piece of music, or
  sing with good taste; who do not regard these as things absolutely incongruous; and who do not
  consider, when they receive applause for excelling in fashionable powers to charm, that the
  offering carries with it an excuse for their being inefficient and helpless mistresses of
  families. There are, however, not a few, who do think that <span class="pagenum"
  id="pageix">{ix}</span>qualifications of a refined nature render it unbecoming in their possessors
  to give that personal superintendence to the affairs of the kitchen, of the store-room, and of all
  the other branches of household arrangement, which is so necessary, that, for the want of it,
  moderate fortunes often prove inadequate to the support of families in the middle rank. Young
  persons cannot be expected to entertain a proper estimation of the value of useful habits, as
  compared with the value of ornamental acquirements, unless they have grown up in the exercise of
  those habits. The idea that capability in the domestic, is incompatible with taste in the elegant
  accomplishments, is so deeply rooted in the minds of most persons who aspire to be fashionable,
  that I despair of the power to do much towards eradicating the fatal error. And yet, I would fain
  represent to parents, the wrong which is done to children by suffering this idea to plant itself
  in their minds; for it not only reduces young women to a standard of comparatively little
  consequence, by making them helpless in all the ordinary business of life, but it produces
  incidentally, a variety of injurious effects on the health, on the spirits, and even on the
  temper. It is proverbial, that the largest portion of happiness belongs not to the higher ranks of
  society; and the reason is, not that the rich and luxurious are, as a matter of course, unworthy
  and consequently unhappy; but that their minds are not diverted by necessary cares, that their
  amusements are easily obtained, and that the enjoyment of them is never interrupted by their
  having duties to perform. Pleasures fail to excite and interest the mind, unless they come in the
  way of relaxation. Therefore it is, that even in youth, something by way of employment is
  necessary to keep gaiety from subsiding into dulness; and in mature life nothing is more salutary
  than occupation. To have <i>something to do</i>, to be obliged to <i>be doing</i>, withdraws the
  mind from the contemplation of fancied sorrows, and prevents its being subdued by the recurrence
  of unavailing regrets. Women who have been accustomed, in their youth, to be industriously engaged
  and to contribute to the daily happiness of others, are sure to enjoy the greatest share of
  tranquillity and satisfaction in a review of days gone by, to show the most courage in adversity,
  the most patience in sickness, and to be the most cheerful and resigned under the infirmities of
  age; and those parents, <span class="pagenum" id="pagex">{x}</span>therefore, who instil into the
  minds of their daughters the principle of <i>making themselves useful</i>, will confer upon them
  one of the greatest of blessings.</p>

  <p>Let it not be supposed, however, that by <i>useful</i>, I mean that a woman should be a mere
  household drudge, that all her ideas should be confined within the limits of her domestic offices,
  or that her guests as well as her family, should be entertained by nothing better than details of
  the household. Ladies who have houses and servants to look after, should be capable of
  superintending the whole in a manner so systematic, as that they may have a due portion of their
  time, and of their thoughts, to give to other, and, if they deem them such, higher matters. I by
  no means recommend, as patterns, the fussy people, who are always busy and have never done, who
  let you know every thing that they have to do, and who, sometimes, do very little after all.
  Neither is it advisable to imitate, too closely, that class of housewives who are distinguished by
  the phrase&mdash;"very <i>particular</i>:" for even the virtue of neatness, when incessantly
  exercised, or manifested too much in matters of little moment, becomes an intruder upon comfort,
  and, consequently, offensive. What I recommend is, that quiet and orderly method of conducting the
  business of a house, which tends rather to conceal than to make an appearance of much to do, which
  puts all that part of the family, who are not immediately engaged in it, as little as possible out
  of the way, and which may enable strangers to remain under the roof without being constantly
  reminded of the trouble they occasion. Every woman who presides over a home, and who wishes to
  preserve its attraction, should bear in mind the many minute cares which all contribute to give to
  that home, not only the semblance, but the substance of enjoyment; and I earnestly impress upon my
  youthful readers the important fact, that, as far as mere fortune is concerned, those often prove
  to be the most poor in reality, who may have been thought to be the most rich. Competence and ease
  may be changed for narrowed circumstances, and a struggle may ensue, to stem a torrent of
  difficulties which follow in succession, and threaten to destroy the home which has been hitherto
  considered secure. Then she who has passed her life in total listlessness, possessing no
  acquirements but of a showy kind, and <span class="pagenum" id="pagexi">{xi}</span>ignorant of
  what is wanted to preserve the foundation of a family's happiness; then such a woman will prove as
  unfitted to lighten sorrow, as she has been careless to avert it: for herself, she can but quail
  as difficulties assail her; for others, she can only seek for protection where, if she were
  capable, she might be of assistance; and, instead of aiding to alleviate distress, she will become
  the main cause of rendering the common burden intolerable.</p>

  <p>How often do we see families stricken to the very dust, by the first, and perhaps only a slight
  blow, of misfortune; and this, merely for the want of a little of that practical knowledge, and
  that experience, which would have enabled them to husband their diminished means so that they
  might still supply sufficient to meet all real wants, and still procure every material comfort.
  From a want of this experience, some of the very best intentioned persons will so misapply the
  resources left to them, at one time laying out money where they ought to refrain altogether, and
  at another parting with more than the occasion requires, that, by degrees, those resources dwindle
  away to nothing before they seem to be aware of the natural consequences, and not only poverty,
  but destitution and misery are let into an abode where comparative ease and contentment might
  still have remained. The great art of economy in domestic life, is comprised in the two very
  homely phrases, "<i>to turn every thing to account</i>," and "<i>to make the most of what you
  have</i>." But their meaning is often perverted, and the habit of <i>turning every thing to an
  account</i>, and of <i>making the most of every thing</i>, is ascribed to those who are actuated,
  not by a laudable desire to produce as much comfort as their circumstances will admit, but by an
  inclination to indulge in a strong propensity to stinginess. But of this class of persons I am far
  from being the advocate; between extravagance and parsimony the widest possible interval exists;
  and that economy, that management and application of means, which I deem perfectly consistent with
  the most rigid virtue and the most generous impulse, is of too admirable a character to partake
  either of the spendthrift's criminality or of the miser's meanness.</p>

  <p>If my censures upon the present system of educating young ladies should appear to be
  presumptuous, I greatly fear that any disapproval of that which is now so <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexii">{xii}</span>universally adopted with regard to <i>the poor</i> will be still more
  unpopular; but it does appear to me that <i>there</i>, there exists a mistake also, which,
  perhaps, in its consequences, will prove still more fatal. It appears to me that something better
  might be done, more advantageous to both rich and poor, by educating the latter to be useful
  members of society; and I think that ladies who live in the country may have ample opportunities
  of training up good servants, by attending to the education of poor neighbours of their own sex.
  By <i>education</i>, I do not mean that kind of teaching which merely qualifies them for reading
  letters and words. Small literary accomplishments, accompanied by idle habits, are already but too
  common, though the fact is more generally known than acknowledged. Nor do I mean that sort of
  education which creates expectations of gaining a livelihood by any other means than those of
  honest industry; or which tends to raise the ideas of persons who are born to work above the
  duties which fortune has assigned to them. I mean such an education as shall better their
  condition, by making them better servants. In large establishments, where there are old and
  experienced persons in service, it is very much the custom to have younger ones as helpers, and
  thus the latter have the benefit of learning all the duties of the household; but these
  establishments are comparatively few in number. The fashion of the day is opposed to my opinion,
  and the same ladies who now condescend to teach poor children to read and write, because it is the
  fashion to do so, would, in many cases, think it beneath them to teach a little girl to make a
  pudding. It would, in a work of this nature, be a hopeless and presumptuous attempt, to argue
  against the all-powerful influence of fashion, against which the keenest shafts of invective and
  ridicule, and in short every weapon of satire, have been so often aimed in vain; but, all are not
  under the dominion of so senseless and so capricious a tyranny, and I have to regret my inability
  to set before my readers the benefits which mistresses of families would confer and receive, from
  bringing up young country girls to be good servants. There might always, in a country-house, be
  one or more young girls, according to the size of the establishment; to be placed under older
  servants, or be instructed by the mistress herself, in all household occupations, from <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexiii">{xiii}</span>the hardest work and most simple offices, to the more
  delicate arts of housekeeping, including needle-work. This practice would not only insure more
  good servants than there now are; but, young girls so trained would, by the force of hourly
  tuition and good example, imbibe a right sense of duty, and acquire good habits, before they could
  have had time to become vicious or unmanageable.</p>

  <p>When ladies take the trouble to teach the poor to read and write, they mean well, no doubt, and
  think they are doing the best they can for their pupils. But teaching industry is more to the
  purpose; for when learning has been found insufficient to preserve the morals of princes, nobles,
  and gentry, how can it be supposed that it will preserve those of their dependents? The
  supposition is, in fact, injurious to the cause of true learning, since the system founded upon it
  has been attended by no moral improvement. Our well-being is best secured by an early habit of
  earning our bread by honest labour; and</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p style="margin-left:-0.40em">"Not to know at large of things remote</p>
    <p>From use, obscure, and subtle, but to know</p>

  </div>

  <p>A country girl, the daughter of a labourer, would, by making herself in some way practically
  useful to society, and gaining a respectable livelihood, be more profitably employed than in going
  through that long course of literary exercise which has, of late, been so generally bestowed on
  the children of poor people, but which, I fear, has not generally imparted to them much of what
  <span class="sc">Milton</span> styles "the prime wisdom." It should also be considered, that the
  literary education of the poor, such as it is, cannot be much more than half completed at the age
  when the children cease to receive lessons from their charitable instructors. They are taught to
  read, to write a little, and perhaps something of the elements of arithmetic. The reading,
  however, is the principal attainment; and in this, they generally become well enough schooled
  before they are eleven, or, at most, twelve years of age. But alas! have they at that age, or at
  the age of thirteen or fourteen, <span class="pagenum" id="pagexiv">{xiv}</span>been taught all
  that is necessary for girls so young to learn, with regard to the <i>choice of books</i>? With the
  use of <i>letters</i>, indeed, as the mere components of words, they have been made acquainted.
  But why have they been taught to read at all, unless there be some profit to be derived from their
  reading; and how can any profit be looked for from that reading, unless there be the same kind of
  pains taken to point out the proper objects of study as there have been to teach the little
  scholars to spell? Surely that advice which is required by all young persons in the pursuit of
  book-learning, is at least as necessary to those who can do no more than just read their own
  native language, as it is to those who are brought up in a superior way. The education of youth,
  among the higher and middle classes, does not terminate, or, at least, it never should,
  immediately on their leaving school. At that period, a fresh series of anxieties occur to the
  parent or the guardian, who is quite as sedulous as before, to finish that which has been, in
  fact, only begun at school. If this be not the case, how is it, that though the son may have been
  eight or ten years at the best schools, the father, after the schooling is ended, finds it
  necessary to consult the most discreet and experienced advisers, concerning the right guidance of
  his child in the course of his future studies? The attention paid to the studies of young ladies,
  after they come from school, is, to be sure, not precisely the same as that which parents think
  requisite for their sons. But, while the daughter has generally the advantage of being with her
  mother, or with some female relative much older than herself; and while the success in life of our
  sex does not so frequently depend upon literary acquirements, and the proper employment of them;
  yet under such circumstances, favourable as they are, we all know that there is still much
  wanting, both in the way of counsel and attractive example, from the parent or guardian, to render
  the learning which a young girl has acquired at school, of substantial service to her in after
  years. If the daughters of the rich require to be taught, not merely to read, but, also,
  <i>what</i> to read, why should not this be the case with the daughters of the poor? in whose
  fate, it is too often proved, that "a little learning is a dangerous thing," owing to the want of
  that discretion which is necessary to prevent the little learning becoming worthless, and even
  mischievous, to its possessor.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexv">{xv}</span></div>

  <p>In the way of practical education, there are many things of importance to the poor, which ought
  to be taught them in early youth. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, a girl should already have
  learned many of the duties of a servant; for if her education up to that age have been neglected,
  she must necessarily, for the next three or four years of her life, be comparatively useless and
  little worthy of trust. The poor do not, as some may suppose, inhale with the air they breathe any
  of that knowledge which is necessary to make them useful in the houses of their parents or their
  employers. To learn cookery, in its various branches; making bread; milking, butter-making, and
  all the many things that belong to a dairy; household offices innumerable; besides the nice art of
  getting up fine linen, and plain work with the needle; not only requires considerable time, but,
  also, unless the learner be uncommonly quick and willing, great attention on the part of the
  person who undertakes to teach them. It is lamentable to see how deficient many female servants
  are in some things, the knowledge of which ought to be thought indispensable. Some are so ignorant
  of plain needle-work as to be incapable of making themselves a gown; and this, too, where they
  happen to be what the country-people call "scholars," from their ability to read a little, and to
  make an awkward use of the pen. A maid-servant who can assist her mistress in plain needle-work,
  is a really valuable person. Strange as it may seem, however, there are but few common servants
  who can do so, notwithstanding that superiority in learning by which the present generation of the
  labouring people are said to be distinguished from their predecessors.</p>

  <p>With young servants, nothing has a better effect than <i>encouragement</i>. If they are, by
  nature, only good tempered, and blest with as much right principle as those who have not been
  spoiled generally possess, whatever you say or do in the way of encouraging them, can hardly fail
  to produce some good, though it may not always accomplish everything that you would desire. A
  cheerful tone in giving directions, a manner of address which conveys the idea of confidence in
  the willingness, as well as the ability, of the person directed, has great influence upon the
  minds of all young persons whose tempers and inclinations have not been warped by ill-usage, or
  soured <span class="pagenum" id="pagexvi">{xvi}</span>by disappointment. Very young servants
  frequently take pride in their work, though of the most laborious kind, and many a young girl
  might be proud to improve in the more refined departments of housewifery, and would regard a
  little congratulation upon the lightness of her pastry, or the excellence of her cakes, as worth
  ten times all the thought and care which she had bestowed upon them. There is no mistress who does
  not acknowledge the importance of a servant who can assist in preserving, pickling, wine-making,
  and other things of this description, which demand both skill and labour, and which must, where
  there is no one but the mistress herself sufficiently acquainted with them to be trusted, take up
  much of her time and give her considerable trouble.</p>

  <p>To teach poor children to become useful servants, may, perhaps, be thought a serious task; but
  it surely cannot be said that this sort of instruction is at all more difficult than that which is
  necessary to give them even a tolerable proficiency in the lowest branches of literature. The
  learning here recommended, seems naturally more inviting, as well as more needful, than that which
  is taught in the ordinary course of school education; and it possesses this advantage, that while
  its benefits are equally lasting, they are immediately perceptible. It is sometimes said that the
  poor are ungrateful, and that after all the pains and trouble which may have been taken in making
  them good servants, it often happens, that instead of testifying a proper sense of the obligation,
  they become restless, and desirous of leaving those who have had all the trouble of qualifying
  them for better places and higher wages. Servants cannot be prevented from bettering themselves,
  as they call it, but that constant changing of place which operates as one of the worst examples
  to young women who are at service, would become less frequent if their employments were
  occasionally varied by relaxation and amusement, and their services now and then rewarded by small
  presents. The influence of early habits is so universally felt and acknowledged, that it seems
  almost superfluous to ask why an early and industrious education of the poor, and the teaching of
  the youth of both sexes to look upon prosperity and right endeavour as inseparable, should not
  produce a taste, the reverse of that which leads to a discontented and unsettled existence.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexvii">{xvii}</span></div>

  <p>It is equally the interest of the rich and of the poor, that the youthful inhabitants of the
  mansion and those of the cottage, should grow up with sentiments of mutual good will. If the poor
  are indebted to their opulent neighbours for the assistance which makes a hard lot tolerable,
  there exists a reciprocal obligation on the part of the rich, since they could not obtain the
  comforts and the luxuries which they enjoy, without the aid of those who are less fortunate than
  themselves. But there is another and superior motive, which ought to narrow the distance between
  the poor and the rich: the lady of the mansion, when she meets her washerwoman in the village
  church, must know that, in that place, she and the hard-working woman are equals. The lady of the
  mansion, when she beholds the ravages which but a few years of toil have wrought in the once
  blooming and healthful country girl, is astonished, perhaps, that her own looks and health have
  not undergone a similar change; but, she forgets that the pitiable creature before her has been
  exposed to the damp floors and steams of a wash-house, to the chill of a cold drying-ground, and
  the oppressive heat of an ironing stove, in order to earn her miserable portion of the necessaries
  of life. No wonder that her beauty has vanished; that her countenance betrays the marks of
  premature age, and that her air of cheerfulness is exchanged for that of a saddened resignation.
  But the lady of the mansion should not, in the confidence of her own happier fate, lose sight of
  the fact, that this poor and destitute creature is a <i>woman</i> as well as herself; that her
  poor inferior is liable to all those delicacies and weaknesses of constitution of which she
  herself is sensible; and that, in the eyes of their Maker, the peeress and the washerwoman hold
  equal rank.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The ingratitude of the poor is often made a pretext for neglecting to relieve their
  wants. But are not their superiors ungrateful? Is "the ingratitude of the world," of which
  philosophers of the earliest ages have said so much, confined to the lowly and unrefined? By no
  means. High birth and refinement in breeding do not, alone, ensure feelings of honour and of
  kindness to the heart, any more than they ensure common sense and sound judgment to the head; for
  these qualities seem to be in the very nature of some, while it passes the power of all art to
  implant them in <span class="pagenum" id="pagexviii">{xviii}</span>others. It is for those who
  have known what adversity is to say whether they have not met with instances of devoted
  attachment, of generosity, and of every other good feeling, on the part of servants, at the very
  time when they have been depressed by the heart-sick sensation caused by the desertion of friends.
  Those have been unfortunate in their experience of human nature, who cannot bear testimony to the
  admirable conduct of servants in fulfilling that wearisome, and often most trying, but at the same
  time most imperative of all earthly duties, attendance upon a sick bed. Perhaps it has not
  occurred to most others, as it has to me, to witness such proofs of virtue in poor people. Among
  the truly charitable there are, no doubt, many in whom disgust has been excited by ingratitude;
  but has it been excited by the hard-working and the half-starving only? It is but a very limited
  acquaintance with this life, which can justify the unselfish and noble nature in denouncing the
  <i>poor</i>, for being ungrateful. Be this, however, as it may, one thing is certain, that no
  probability of disappointment, no apprehensions of an ungrateful return, ought to have any
  influence with the mind of a Christian, and that such obstacles were never yet a hinderance to any
  man or woman whose desire was to do good.</p>

  OBSERVATIONS.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">It</span> would be impossible to give rules for the management of a domestic
  establishment, because they would necessarily be subject to many and various exceptions, produced
  by various circumstances. But a few general observations, accompanied by remarks on the most
  important matters in domestic life, may not be unacceptable to young housekeepers.</p>

  <p>In the young and thoughtless, a spirit of emulation, leading them to vie with those who are
  richer than themselves, is often the source of domestic unhappiness, by causing so much to be
  sacrificed to appearance, as to circumscribe the means of enjoying the substantial comforts of
  life. It sometimes manifests itself in houses, equipages, and retinues of servants; but amongst
  persons of moderate income, for whose use this work is principally intended, it is commonly
  displayed in costly furniture and expensive entertainments. Many young married women conceive the
  notion, that unless they have as fine a house, as expensive furniture, plate, china, and glass, as
  some others have, and give as fine entertainments as others give; in short, unless they make the
  appearance of living quite as well as their richer neighbours, they will not be held in equal
  estimation. It is not that they derive any real pleasure from the false appearance which they
  make; indeed, expensive furniture is but an annoyance to its possessor, if there be not a
  sufficient number of good servants to keep it in order. Where the whole family concur in this sort
  of pride, no <span class="pagenum" id="page2">{2}</span>mortification arises from difference of
  opinion, but the unanimity tends only to accelerate the ruin.</p>

  <p>The young housekeeper should consider the serious consequences that are likely to result from
  setting out in a style of lavish expenditure, and she should remember that, while it is easy to
  extend, it is extremely difficult to reduce, her establishment. One expensive article requires
  another to correspond with it, and one expensive entertainment imposes the necessity of other
  equally expensive entertainments; for it requires no small share of moral courage to risk the loss
  of consequence which may result by its being surmised that we are not so well off, as we have been
  supposed to be. And when the time comes, as sooner or later it assuredly must, when the means are
  not adequate to the demands, what sacrifices are made, and what unseemly contrivances are resorted
  to, in order to keep up, to the last, a poor remnant of "<i>appearance!</i>" and, when this can no
  longer be effected, then comes the humiliation, with all the bitter feelings attendant upon
  <i>retrenchment</i>; of all which feelings, the bitterest is, the dread of being degraded in the
  world's estimation. To endure privations with resignation, to feel the want of habitual comforts,
  yet be grateful for the blessings which are left to us, is the duty of every Christian, and is the
  less arduous when the reverse of fortune which has befallen us, has not been produced by any fault
  of our own. But if, in addition to the distresses of adversity, the wife and the mother be doomed
  to writhe under the pang of self-reproach, great indeed must be her suffering, and one for which I
  can suggest no adequate relief. To the young and generous-minded, the hardest portion which
  accompanies reverses of fortune, is, the change which they sometimes produce in the behaviour of
  acquaintances. When we are become poorer than we were, and have lost the ability to entertain
  guests in the accustomed manner, it is painful to perceive some of those very people who have been
  the most hospitably entertained, and who, in our prosperity, have appeared the most attached to
  us, turn from us and our difficulties, while they banish from their minds the recollection of past
  kindness. To meet with indifference in those whose smiles have courted ours; to feel that we have
  thrown away sincere friendship upon mere heartlessness, is hard to be endured, even by the
  faultless, but how <span class="pagenum" id="page3">{3}</span>intolerable must it be, when
  aggravated by the consciousness that we have incurred it by our own misconduct. To the
  experienced, this is one of the severest vicissitudes of life; what, then, must it be to us,
  before we have acquired that equanimity of mind, which falls only to the lot of those who have
  passed through the ordeal of the world, and who have been amply compensated for the desertion of
  the many, by the sincerity, the warmth of heart, and the steadfastness of the few.</p>

  <p>Houses and furniture properly belong to the extraordinary expenses of the household. When a
  young woman is called upon to exercise her judgment in the choice of a house, she must pause
  before she rejects one which, though she may consider it rather too small, might, nevertheless, be
  made to accommodate the family <i>well enough</i>, and might be fitted up at a less cost than a
  larger one. Such a house would require fewer servants, and would certainly present a better
  appearance, than one that is rather too large for the quantity, or for the style of its furniture,
  and is, perhaps, larger than is actually required for the number of its inhabitants. It is easier
  to remove from a small to a large house, when circumstances require it, than it is to remove from
  a large to a small one. It is so easy to increase our wants, and so difficult to reduce them, that
  young persons should begin the world with caution, and not multiply their wants, lest, in time,
  they lack the means of gratifying them.</p>

  <p>In fitting up a house, the young housekeeper, who sets out with a determination to choose
  furniture suitable to her circumstances and station in life, will be content with that which is
  just <i>good enough</i>, rather than be induced to exceed her previous good intentions, and
  gratify her fancy at the expense of her comforts. She must never yield to the seductive
  reflection, that "<i>only</i> five pounds more cannot make much difference;" for, the same
  argument may be equally applied to the sofa, the tables, the carpet, the curtains, the grate, the
  fire-irons and fender; all of which are necessary to furnish a dining room; to say nothing of the
  lamps, the mirrors, and other articles of ornament, which fashion in some cases makes of absolute
  necessity. If "<i>only five pounds</i>" be given for some of these, and two, or even one pound,
  for others, more than is necessary, she <span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>will find that
  the "difference" is very great by the time that she has fitted up only one room.</p>

  <p>The rage for vying with our superiors shows itself in the bad taste which encumbers houses with
  unsuitable furniture. Massive sideboards, and unwieldy chairs, occupy too much space in a small
  room, while draperies not only obscure the light, but have an inelegant appearance, unless the
  room be large and lofty, or in keeping with the size and weight of cornices, cords, tassels, and
  other ornaments, which give offence to the eye when too gorgeous or prominent. Of equal bad taste,
  is the habit of occasionally changing furniture, to suit the varying of fashions; which is so much
  the practice that even persons in trade, having families to provide for, change furniture,
  sufficiently good to serve its purpose for a lifetime, for other no handsomer, but a little more
  fashionable.</p>

  <p>It is strange that persons pretending to gentility should not rather imitate the higher class
  of their superiors, who value their high-backed chairs the more because they are old, and would on
  no account exchange them for modern finery. When expensive furniture is introduced into the houses
  of persons of small fortune, the long upholsterer's bill rises like a phantom before the misplaced
  couches, ottomans, and ottoman sofas, crowded into small drawing rooms; and my feelings of regret
  become almost feelings of indignation on seeing plate, which belonged to fathers and mothers, or
  to grandfathers and grandmothers, and spoons which have touched those lips which spoke tenderness
  to our infancy, about to be bartered for the "Prince's," the "King's," or the "fiddle pattern," or
  for some other pattern that may happen to offer the newest temptation to vulgar taste.</p>

  <p>Every young woman who has the good taste to wish that her house may be characterised by its
  simplicity, and be more remarkable for comfort than for show, will, if she wish to spare herself
  and her family much discomfort, avoid having show-rooms; such rooms, I mean, as are considered too
  fine to be habitually occupied by the family, and are, therefore, kept shut up; except when, on
  particular occasions, and perhaps only a few times in the year, a fire is lighted for the
  reception of company. Upon such occasions, children are seen to look about them as if they <span
  class="pagenum" id="page5">{5}</span>had never beheld the place before; the master of the house
  fidgets from one seat to another, as if he were anywhere but at home; and it is probable, that
  before the entertainment is over, the mistress of the house is heard to remark, that she is "never
  so comfortable as in the room she is accustomed to;" by which her friends discover that their
  visit has put her out of the way. True hospitality conceals from guests any trouble which their
  presence may unavoidably occasion; but in the luxurious taste of the times, there is little real
  hospitality left: friendly intercourse seems lost in ostentatious display, and in our vain
  attempts to equal, if not to outshine, each other. Most persons acknowledge this to be the case,
  and lament that it is so; yet few have the courage to pursue a different system.</p>

  <p>There is no species of decoration which produces so much effect in ornamenting a house as
  flowers. The artificial productions of the painter and the upholsterer, the gilded ceilings,
  glittering mirrors, and couches of brocade, are more splendid and durable, and are worthy of
  admiration for their individual beauty and the ingenuity and industry which has produced them, but
  they have not the lively, gay, and varied attractions of flowers. Vases, whether gaudy or elegant,
  excite interest only as mere objects of curiosity, unless filled with flowers.</p>

  <p>To point to any particular department of the household, as demanding the greatest share of
  attention, would tend rather to mislead than instruct; for a due proportion ought to be bestowed
  upon every department; where the mistress of the house is over particular on any one point, other
  matters, of equal importance, may be neglected.</p>

  <p>Perfect and uniform neatness is indispensable, not only for comfort, but appearance. By uniform
  neatness, I mean, that nothing which presents itself, whether about the house, in the dress of
  mistress, children, or servants, should be left open to unfavourable remark. A young lady who
  relaxes in attention to her own dress, merely because she has more important cares after, than she
  had before her marriage, does wrong; but she whose studied attire forms a contrast to the little
  soiled fingers which are forbidden to approach it; she who strikes the beholder as having bestowed
  care on herself, while her children bear the appearance of neglect, does infinitely worse. To
  preserve the <span class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span>neatness of a house, there must be regular
  attention on the part of the mistress. I am a great enemy to the system of periodical scrubbings
  and general house-cleanings, which prevails to so great an extent, and especially in the country,
  where, when the appointed day comes round, carpets are taken up, and floors, even though they be
  delicately clean, are washed, whether the weather be suitable or otherwise, the health of the
  family being left to take its chance. The day of <i>general house-cleaning</i> is no other than a
  day of commotion and discomfort. One attendant evil is, the make-up dinner, which does not,
  perhaps, content all the family; and it is a singular piece of good fortune if friends do not
  select that very day for paying you a visit. It is certainly a more simple process to clean a
  house, than it is to keep a house clean; for mere labour is required for the one, while method is
  necessary for the other. But this method every young housekeeper should endeavour to acquire.
  Sweeping, dusting, and polishing, should proceed daily. Carpets should be swept every day with a
  hair broom; but only once a week with a carpet broom, because it wears them: and damp tea leaves
  should always be used, whether in sweeping carpets or boards, as they lay the dust, which would
  otherwise fly over the furniture, and again settle on the floor. Bed room carpets should be in
  different pieces, not nailed to the floor, for the convenience of shaking, which may then be done
  once in a week. Bed rooms should be swept every day, and a damp mop passed under the beds, chests
  of drawers, &amp;c., &amp;c., which will remove all the flue and dust, and prevent accumulation of
  dirt, so that the washing of boards will not be so often required during the winter. In summer,
  indeed, frequent washings refreshen the atmosphere, and are also beneficial in removing the
  collections of light dust which engender insects so difficult to get rid of.</p>

  <p>Upon the subject of wet boards, I believe that my dislike to great scrubbings was acquired in
  that cleanest of cities, Philadelphia; where, though American servants do not and will not work so
  hard as English servants, yet, because it was the custom of the place, they were, notwithstanding
  severe cold, everlastingly scrubbing the stairs during the months of December and January. Some
  years afterwards, at Rome, one of the dirtiest of cities, and in the middle of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span>summer, I recalled to mind, with a complacency I had never
  bestowed on them before, the scrubbing-brushes and the curd-white pails of Philadelphia, and
  marvelled, as every one must, that in wet and cold countries people wash their houses so much, and
  that, in hot and dry countries, they do not wash them at all.</p>

  <p>With regard to the ordinary expenses of housekeeping, the most important branch of domestic
  duty which devolves upon the mistress is, to estimate and keep an exact account of the expenditure
  of her family. She may make this a simple affair by first ascertaining the sum of money to be
  allotted to it, and then making such arrangements as will confine the expenses rigidly
  <i>within</i> that sum. By keeping a strict account of every article for the first three months,
  and making a due allowance for casualties, she will be able to form an estimate for the year; and
  if she find she has exceeded in these three months the allotted sum, she must examine each
  article, and decide where she can best diminish the expense; and then, having this average to go
  by, she may calculate how much to allow each month for meat, bread, groceries, washing, and
  sundries. Having formed her plan, whatever excess circumstances may have required in one month,
  she must make up for in the next. I should not advise paying for everything at the moment, but
  rather once a week; for if a tradesman omit to keep an account of the money received for a
  particular article, he may, by mistake, make a charge for it, as something had upon trust. A
  weekly account has every advantage of ready money, and is a more convenient mode of payment. All
  tradesmen may be paid on a Monday morning, the bills receipted, endorsed, and put by in a
  portfolio or case (which should have the date of the year on the outside), and they can then be
  referred to as vouchers, or to refresh the memory as to the price of any particular article. It is
  a satisfaction, independently of the pecuniary benefit, for the head of a family to be able, at
  the end of the year, to account to herself for what she has done with her money.</p>

  <p>Having, in the arrangement of her house, and in the choice of her servants, kept in view the
  two main objects, namely, the comfort of her family, and the care of her purse, the young
  housekeeper ought to commence her career, by strictly adhering to order and regularity in the
  <span class="pagenum" id="page8">{8}</span>performance of those duties which devolve peculiarly
  upon herself. If the mistress of a house be regular in the superintendence of her domestic
  affairs, if she proceed every day to each department at the appointed time, and never pass over
  any neglect, in such a manner as to give the servants an idea that it had escaped her observation;
  if, in short, she be regular herself, her servants must be so too, and she will find the business
  of housekeeping a matter of no difficulty, and of comparatively little labour.</p>

  <p>The comfort and respectability of a house depend, in a great degree, upon the servants. Clean,
  neatly-dressed, and well-behaved servants, always impress a visitor with a favourable idea of the
  mistress of a house; while it is scarcely possible not to be somewhat prejudiced against her, if
  they be the reverse.</p>

  <p>Servants who understand their work, and do it without being continually looked after, are
  invaluable; and, as regards wages, not to be compared with ignorant and incapable ones, who
  perform their services only as they are directed at every turn. A few pounds a year more to a good
  servant is not, therefore, a consideration; the addition in wages will occasion little additional
  cost; for, the bad servant consumes as much as the other, and she wastes or damages more.</p>

  <p>The hours of meals should vary as little as possible; particularly the first meal of the day;
  for the work may be said to commence immediately after breakfast, and when that takes place one
  hour only, after the usual time, the whole business of the house is retarded. In even the most
  regular families, the time of dining may unavoidably be postponed. But this should happen as
  seldom as possible: for if the dinner ordered for five, be kept waiting till half-past six, one
  day, and, perhaps, later still another day, the cook may be prevented from performing some other
  part of her work, for which she had allotted the time; she will naturally be dissatisfied in
  having to consume that time in watching over the dinner; and if the dinner upon which she has,
  perhaps, exerted her utmost skill, be spoiled by waiting, she may be excused if she reproach
  herself for having taken so much trouble in its preparation. If the trial of her patience and
  temper be repeated, she will soon take little interest in pleasing her employers; she will <span
  class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>take <i>her</i> turn to be irregular, and that, perhaps, on
  some occasion when it may produce inconvenience to the family. Under such circumstances, it would
  be unreasonable to find fault with the cook, who would only be following the bad example of those
  whose duty it is to preserve regularity. Their hours for going to bed, and getting up, should be
  as early as other arrangements will permit. But, those ought to be so regulated as to make it
  unnecessary that the servants should be kept up late, except on extraordinary occasions. Late
  dinners have, in a great measure, done away with hot suppers. Where these are not eaten, the
  labours of the twenty-four hours may be ended by ten o'clock at night; and that is the latest hour
  at which the servants of a family of the middle rank, and of regular habits, ought to remain up.
  Some one of the family should see that fires have been put out, and doors and windows secured.</p>

  <p>The honesty of servants depends, principally, upon their bringing up. But it also depends much,
  with young servants especially, upon the temptations to be dishonest they may have had to contend
  with; and it is the duty of every master and mistress to put all such temptations out of their
  way, as much as possible. The practice of locking up does not, as a matter of course, imply
  <i>distrust</i>, but it denotes <i>care</i>; and surely carefulness is one of the first principles
  to impress upon the mind of a poor person. I would as scrupulously avoid anything which should
  lead a servant to imagine that a drawer or tea-chest was locked up from <i>her</i>, as I would
  avoid giving the same idea to an acquaintance; but it is a culpable practice to leave tea, sugar,
  wine, or other things, open at all times, or only now and then locked up. The <i>habit</i> is bad;
  and it is the result, not of generosity, but of negligence; it is also a habit which cannot fail
  to excite, in the minds of experienced and well-disposed servants, feelings rather of contempt,
  than of respect for their employers; while to the young, and more particularly to those of
  unsettled principles, it is nothing less than a temptation to crime. Little pilferings at the
  tea-chest, perhaps, have been the beginning of that which has ended in depriving a poor girl of
  her character, and, consequently, of all chance of gaining her bread by honest means. To suspect
  servants of being disposed to be dishonest merely because they are servants, is as silly as it is
  unfeeling. I should <span class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}</span>never hesitate to give my keys to
  a servant, when it happened to be inconvenient to me to leave company, any more than I should
  hesitate to entrust them to one of my own family; but such an act of confidence is far different
  in its effects, from that neglect which often proceeds from mere idleness, and, while it proclaims
  a disregard of the value of property, is the occasion of much waste, and, in the end, proves as
  ruinous to the employer as it is fatal in the way of example to servants.</p>

  <p>That "<i>servants are plagues</i>" may be the fact; but when the hardships which belong to the
  life of a maid-servant are taken into consideration, the wonder is, that they are not less
  obedient to the will of their employers, and more callous to their displeasure, than we really
  find them. It is too much the habit to regard servants as inferior beings, hired and paid to
  perform certain services, but whose feelings are unworthy of the consideration of those upon whom
  they wait, for whom they cook, and whom they enable to sit at their ease, or to go about, and take
  their pleasure. True, they are paid for what they do; but how paid? Not in a degree adequate to
  their services. The double or the treble of what they are paid, would not compensate us for the
  discomfort of having to work for ourselves. Yet, "they are <i>paid</i> for it," is said in
  justification of unreasonable demands upon the time, strength, and patience of servants; when, in
  fact, the whole of the pay to a female servant consists of that food, without which she would be
  unable to work, and of a sum of money, barely sufficient to keep her clothed, which she is
  required to be, for the credit of the house she lives in. Ladies who shudder as they meet the cold
  air, in descending to their breakfast rooms, forget the sufferings of the female servant, who has,
  perhaps, gone to bed over-night exhausted by fatigue, but whose duty compels her to rise again,
  some hours before she is rested, to begin her work afresh, and to do over again all that had been
  done the day before. A lady who thinks her servant <i>sufficiently paid</i> for all she endures,
  has never known what it is to get up in the dark of a cold winter morning, and to spend
  half-an-hour on her knees, labouring to produce a polish on the bars of a grate, which bars were
  burnt black yesterday, and will be burnt black again to-day. Such a lady has never suffered from
  the drudgery of a kitchen, not <span class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}</span>from the scorching of
  a kitchen fire, either of which is sufficient to impair the constitution of any woman,
  independently of all that wearing of the spirits, which those exposed to such trials must
  experience.</p>

  <p>It is true, also, that it is by their own choice that servants go to service; they are not
  compelled to do so by any other law than that of necessity; but starvation is their only
  alternative; and we should think it hard to be reduced to the alternative of either starving to
  death, in the bloom of our youth, and of quitting a world which was made for us, as well as for
  our more fortunate fellow beings, or of yielding up the whole of our lives, to promote the ease of
  those who deem us amply rewarded, in being fed and clothed, and suffered to repose from toil, at
  those times only when their wants happen not to require our attention.</p>

  <p>The apprehension of lowering our dignity and encouraging disrespect, by giving way to
  familiarity with inferiors, is pleaded by some as an excuse for haughty and overbearing demeanour
  towards servants. But such as adopt that kind of demeanour are mistaken. There are few better
  judges of good breeding than servants. Their ideas upon this subject are not formed by rules, or
  by fashions; but they have generally, from observation, a remarkably correct knowledge both of
  what is due to themselves, and of what is most becoming to the dignity of their superiors. I have
  occasionally been astonished at the quickness with which a servant has made the discovery, that
  some upstart person, notwithstanding her lofty bearing, "was no lady." The behaviour which
  characterises such persons is more likely to give rise to contempt, in those who are beneath them,
  than any behaviour that is unaffectedly conciliating and kind. To be loved, and to be cheerfully
  served, is for those only who respect the feelings, and consult the comfort of their dependents;
  and, as a single trait is often sufficient to reveal the whole character, they will most assuredly
  be disappointed, who expect to meet with the qualities which conduce to the happiness of domestic
  life, in a woman who considers the feelings of a female servant as unworthy of the same
  consideration as that which she gives to the feelings of others of her own sex.</p>

  <p>With regard to the general character and merits of servants, nothing is more common than the
  remark, that <span class="pagenum" id="page12">{12}</span>"servants are not so good as they used
  to be." This is surely an error. There cannot be a greater predisposition to misconduct in them
  now than formerly. It may be said, that there are more frequent instances of bad conduct; but this
  does not warrant the idea, that the servants of the present day have a degree of inborn
  viciousness from which those of times past were free. If all who rail at the negligences, the
  waste, the want of care, the dislike of work, and the liking for dress and for gadding, to which
  servants are as much addicted as their betters; if all such were themselves as free from fault as
  they would have their servants be, it would probably be found that the effect, what with precept
  and example combined, would be quite enough to banish this commonplace remark. The truth is, that
  the change which has taken place in the habits of the middle class, has produced a change, but a
  very natural change, in the habits of those of a more humble station. There exists now a greater
  degree of high living than formerly; and consequently, a want of frugality, a waste in all sorts
  of ways, formerly unknown. Persons of moderate income keep more company than persons of the same
  class used to keep; they imitate the late hours, and other fashionable habits which used to be
  reckoned among the privileges of their superiors in fortune, instead of wisely avoiding emulation
  in such things, and keeping to their own more simple, and less hazardous mode of life. What
  wonder, then, if we find the most humble copying those of the middling, when the middling are
  doing all they can to rival those of the highest rank.</p>

  <p>Servants were formerly more the object of care with their employers than they have been of
  late. When ladies gave a considerable portion of their time to domestic duties, and prided
  themselves on their skill in household matters, they were not above maintaining a certain degree
  of friendly intercourse with their servants. This afforded opportunities for giving good counsel,
  and for superintending their conduct, and was a more efficient check upon them than "a good
  scolding now and then," which many think better than "being always on the watch."</p>

  <p>In addressing myself to young persons, it may not be considered impertinent or foreign to the
  general purpose of this work, to offer a few remarks upon the subject of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page13">{13}</span>company. I do not mean in respect to the selection of friends and
  acquaintance, or the <i>kind</i> of visitors proper to be invited, but simply as to the mode of
  entertaining them, which must, necessarily, be a matter of importance in housekeeping, and,
  therefore, comes properly within the scope of domestic economy.</p>

  <p class="sp5">It should be a rule, not to invite such visitors as cannot be entertained without
  trespassing on the comforts and conveniences of the family. True hospitality may be enjoyed
  without much ceremony, and may be practised in the plainest manner; but when efforts to entertain
  <i>company</i> disturb the usual arrangements of a house, they are inconsistent with their object.
  Let nothing, therefore, be attempted which cannot be performed without difficulty; let nothing be
  provided which cannot be provided plentifully; let nothing which is necessary be wanting, and
  nothing produced which may seem to be out of place or uncalled for. Do nothing, in short, which
  you cannot really afford to do; and the result will be, that while you consult your own ease, you
  will, at the same time, ensure that freedom from restraint which contributes, more than all
  besides, to make visiting agreeable, and which never fails to create in your departing guest,
  those mixed feelings of regret at going, but of pleasure at the prospect of returning, which are
  amongst the most flattering acknowledgments that genuine hospitality can receive.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="II. The Store Room" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER II.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE STORE ROOM.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Every</span> housekeeper knows the value of a good Store-room; for it seems to
  be little less essential than a good kitchen. Few modern town residences, except those for large
  establishments, have a store-room sufficiently large to answer all its purposes.</p>

  <p>In the country a good store-room is so indispensable that where there is none it ought to be
  built; it should be on the same floor with, and as near as possible to, the kitchen; and as this
  would be on the ground floor, it would be necessary to make a cellar underneath, or to raise the
  building a little distance from the ground, to prevent its being damp, above all things to be
  guarded against, in a place where stores are kept. It may, perhaps, be kept dry by flues from the
  kitchen fire; and this would be a saving of fuel and labour; but if not practicable, the room
  should have a fire-place.</p>

  <p>If it be sufficiently large, and there be no other place for the purpose, there might be a
  closet, or press, for household linen. This should always be kept in a dry situation, and in some
  houses a small room is fitted up, with closets or presses round it, some of these having shelves
  or drawers for linen, and others with hooks, for a variety of things belonging to a family; but in
  this room there ought to be a fire-place, unless it be aired by one adjoining. In the store-room,
  there should be a closet or shelves for china and glass, not in every-day use. But as these ought
  to be free from dust, open shelves would not be so desirable as a closet; and if expense is not of
  importance, glass doors would be the most convenient. Preserves and pickles require air; they will
  ferment if shut up, or the place very warm; and, therefore, open shelves are best for them; and
  they should be at a convenient distance from the ground, so as not to be out of sight, for they
  ought to be examined frequently, and the coverings dusted. For <span class="pagenum"
  id="page15">{15}</span>bottles of green gooseberries, peas, or any kind of fruit preserved dry,
  without sugar, have shelves with holes in them, to turn the bottles with their necks downwards.
  This effectually excludes the air.</p>

  <p>A dresser is a convenience in a store-room; or a table in the middle of the room may answer the
  purpose; but in either of these, or at the bottom of the linen press, there should be drawers for
  dusters, tea-cloths, &amp;c., &amp;c., unless they be kept in the Pantry.</p>

  <p>There should be boxes for candles and soap, but as these smell, the store-boxes may be kept in
  a garret, or some dry place, and a smaller quantity in the store-room for immediate use. Late in
  the summer is the best time to provide the year's stock of candles and soap. Both are the better
  for being kept some time before they are used: and the latter should be cut in pieces the size
  required for the different household purposes, and left, before packed in the box, a few days
  exposed to the air; but not in a thorough draught, for that would cause the soap to crack. It is
  mismanagement to buy candles a few at a time, and soap just as it is wanted; and not good to buy
  cheap candles. The dearest articles are not always the best; but it is very certain that the best
  are the cheapest. Good candles afford more light than bad; and do not waste, particularly if they
  have been kept some time, even for a year.</p>

  <p>There ought to be a place in the store-room appropriated to groceries, for they, too, should be
  laid in, not oftener than two or three times a year. The price of starch varies with the price of
  flour; and, therefore, as it keeps well, a stock should be laid in when flour is at a low price.
  Rice keeps very well, and is useful in a family, particularly in the country, where new milk and
  eggs are plenty. We once kept a quantity more than three years, by spreading a well-aired linen
  sheet in a box, and folding it over the rice, the sheet lifted out on the floor, once in two or
  three months, and the rice spread about upon the sheet for a day or two. This had the effect of
  keeping away the weevil. Jars and canisters, with closely fitting lids, for tea, sugar, coffee,
  cocoa, mustard, pepper, spices, and such things, will last many years. By giving, in the course of
  the year, one or two large orders, to any respectable shop, and always to the same one, you may
  pretty well depend upon <span class="pagenum" id="page16">{16}</span>being supplied with good
  articles; but not so, if you send here and there, and for small quantities at a time; besides the
  inconvenience of finding yourself, now and then, without the very thing which you want. To dispose
  of these things properly, they should be kept in a closet, some in earthen jars, others in tin or
  japan boxes; and the spices in little drawers very closely fitted. If drawers, which are
  preferable, they should be labelled.</p>

  <p>As it may be convenient sometimes to perform little culinary matters in the store-room, there
  should be a rolling pin, pasteboard, and pestle and mortar kept there, in addition to those of the
  kitchen, and on this account a small marble slab would be very useful, for making pastry in hot
  weather. The fire-place might have an oven attached to it; for though it would be imprudent to
  heat the store-room, on account of preserves, &amp;c., it may be occasionally used, when there is
  more cooking than usual. Besides which, in the season for making preserves, a hot plate in the
  store-room would be found useful. Weights and scales of various sizes are absolutely necessary,
  that the housekeeper may be able to ascertain the weight of the largest joint of meat, as well as
  of the smallest quantity of spice. Care should be taken to keep these in good order.&mdash;A
  hanging shelf is also a good thing in a store-room. Here the flour-bin may find a place, if there
  be no other more suitable.</p>

  <p>A store-room of this description is not adapted for keeping fruit; it would be too warm,
  besides that the fruit might prove injurious to other stores, from the smell which it occasions.
  There are various methods of keeping apples through the winter; but scarcely any other will be
  found to succeed so well as that of making layers of fruit, and layers of perfectly fresh and dry
  straw, in hampers, boxes, or the corner of a dry room. The apples should be examined every now and
  then, the specked ones taken away for use, the others wiped, and covered up again. In hard frosts,
  windows that have no shutters could be covered with rugs, old carpet, or mats, and something of
  the same kind spread over the apples. When we were in America, we were surprised to find that our
  neighbours took so little care to preserve their apples, during the three months of unremitting
  hard frost, which occur in their winter season. They merely <span class="pagenum"
  id="page17">{17}</span>laid their apples on the floor of a spare room, sometimes of the barn, or
  of an outhouse, each sort by itself, and then covered them with a linen sheet. The people told us
  that their apples never became frozen, and attributed this to the dryness of the atmosphere.
  Apples and pears may also be preserved in the following way. Gather them on a dry day: wipe, and
  roll them, singly, in very soft paper, then pack them in jars, each containing about a gallon. Put
  a cover on the jar, and cement it closely, so as to keep out the air; and place the jar in a dry
  cellar. When a jar is opened, the fruit will eat the better for being taken out of the paper, and
  exposed to the air of a warm room for two or three days. Large baking pears may be suspended by
  their stalks on lines, placed across near the ceiling of a room. There are many ways of preserving
  grapes; but the best way is, to gather them with about five or six inches of the branch to each
  bunch, to seal the end with common sealing wax, and hang them to lines in a dry room. Examine them
  frequently, and cut out the mouldy berries. Nuts of all kinds may be preserved in jars, the covers
  cemented, the jars in a dry cellar.</p>

  <p>In this short sketch of what a store-room ought to be, even in the plainest houses in the
  country, many things requisite to the fitting up of a complete one are omitted. But one thing more
  necessary to be observed than any other, must not be omitted; which is, that it must be always in
  order, and everything kept in its proper place, or the main object in having it will be defeated.
  A store-room out of order can be compared to nothing but a drawer in a state of confusion. A lady
  once dressing in haste, to keep an appointment for which she was already too late, needed the
  assistance of all about her, to aid in her search for different articles necessary to complete her
  toilet. I sought a pair of gloves, and discovered many single ones of various sorts and colours,
  but no two to form a perfect match. And with this ill success must have ended my labours, if the
  drawer had not been regularly <i>put to rights</i>: and by the time that scarfs were folded,
  ribands rolled, collars smoothed, and scissors disentangled from sewing silk, half a dozen gloves
  were paired.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The saving of time occasioned by observing order, and the waste of time occasioned
  by want of order, are <span class="pagenum" id="page18">{18}</span>incalculable. A general putting
  to rights, every now and then, does not answer the purpose, because, in that case, it is sure to
  happen that some things will find new places; and persons coming in a hurry be unable to find
  them. The mistress of a house, when she sends her servant or a child to a store-room, should be
  able to say precisely where what she wants may be found. Negligence, and its companion disorder,
  are the two demons of housekeeping. Once admit them, and, like the moth, they gradually but
  completely destroy.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="III. The Pantry" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER III.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE PANTRY.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">What</span> is commonly called the <i>Butler's Pantry</i>, does not of
  necessity imply the presence of a butler; nor does it require to be spacious, when the china and
  glass not in daily use are kept in the store-room. Where women servants only are kept, the care of
  the pantry belongs either to the parlourmaid or the housemaid, and the same servant usually
  performs the office of laying the cloth, and waiting at table: which is always done better by
  women than by men servants, except it be the higher order of men servants, those who are in the
  daily practice of it, and whose occupation is in the house. The same hands which, in the morning,
  rubbed down the horses, swept the stable, cleaned the harness, and blackened the shoes, seem unfit
  to be employed in placing dishes on the dining-table, folding up napkins, and handling tea-things.
  It is almost impossible that occupations so widely differing should be equally well suited to one
  and the same person. The employing of men servants in work which properly belongs to women is
  highly objectionable; and nothing renders travelling in the South of France and Italy so
  disagreeable as being waited on by men, acting as housemaids and chambermaids. If, indeed, men
  were employed to scrub the floor, wash the stone halls, and clean the dirty doorsteps in London,
  the lives of many female servants might be saved. But the more delicate <span class="pagenum"
  id="page19">{19}</span>occupations, such as wiping glasses, trimming candles, and waiting in the
  parlour, seem more suitable for women.</p>

  <p>Some women servants, it is true, never learn to wait at table well; but, then, others are very
  expert at it. Short people are generally the most nimble, but it is desirable that the servant who
  waits at table be tall, for the convenience of setting on and taking off dishes; and it requires
  long arms to carry heavy mahogany trays. Practice is as necessary to good waiting as it is in any
  of the higher domestic occupations. The mistress, therefore, should require the same particularity
  in preparing the table, arranging the sideboard, and waiting at dinner, when her family dines
  alone, as she requires when there are visitors; because, in the latter case, an increase in number
  gives sufficient additional trouble to a servant, without her being thrown into confusion by
  having to do what she may have forgotten, from being out of practice.</p>

  <p>There is one item of expenditure in housekeeping which should not be too narrowly restricted,
  and that is the washing of table-cloths and napkins. The fineness is not so much a matter of
  consideration with me: neither should I desire a clean table-cloth every day, merely for the sake
  of the change; but, if at all soiled, I would rather not see it on the table again. It is a very
  neat practice to spread a napkin on the centre of the table, large or small according to the size
  of the latter, and to remove it with the meat. In Italy this napkin is clean every day, and I have
  seen it folded in a three-cornered shape, and then crimped at the edges with the thumb and finger,
  which, when the napkin was spread out, gave it a pretty appearance. It is also a neat practice to
  place the dessert on the table cloth, and a convenient one too, where there are few servants,
  because the cloth saves the table; and rubbing spots out of dining tables, day after day, seems
  waste of labour. But the cloth must be preserved from gravy spots, or it will disgrace the
  dessert. A baize between two cloths is sometimes used, and this, being rolled up with the upper
  cloth and removed with the dinner, leaves the under cloth for the dessert. A table cloth <i>once
  folded</i> may be laid over the one which is spread, and then removed with the dinner. A table
  cloth press is a convenience.</p>

  <p>The fitting up of the pantry must, in a great measure, be <span class="pagenum"
  id="page20">{20}</span>regulated by the style of the establishment, but, in any case, there should
  be a dresser, furnished with drawers, one for table cloths, napkins and mats (unless all these be
  kept in sideboard drawers); another for tea cloths, glass cloths, dusters, &amp;c. &amp;c., and
  another drawer lined with baize, for the plate which is in use. Plate-leathers, flannels and
  brushes, kept in a bag; and the cloths and brushes used in cleaning furniture, in another bag, to
  preserve them from dust. A small sink, with the water laid on, indispensable. There should also be
  a horse, or lines, for drying tea and glass cloths upon.</p>

  <p>China and glass, whether plain or of the finest kind, require to be kept equally clean; and the
  servant whose business this is ought to have soft cloths for the purpose. China should be washed
  in warm water, with a piece of flannel, and wiped with a clean and soft cloth, or it will look
  dull. Glass washed in cold water, drained nearly dry, and then wiped; if the cloth be not clean
  and dry, the glasses will not look clear. For cut glass a brush, because a cloth will not reach
  into the crevices to polish it; and dull looking salts, or other cut glass, spoil the appearance
  of a table. Wash lamps and lustres with soap and cold water. When looking glasses are become
  tarnished and dull, thump them over with a linen bag containing powdered blue, and wipe it off
  with a soft cloth.</p>

  <p>Paper trays are the best, considering the small difference in the price, compared with the
  great difference in the appearance: it would be better to save in many other things, than to hear
  tea-things, glasses, or snuffers, jingle on japan. Paper trays are very durable, if taken care of.
  They will seldom require washing; but when they do, the water should only be lukewarm, for if hot
  water be poured on them the paper will blister. Wipe clean with a wet cloth, and when dry, dust a
  little flour over, and wipe that off with a soft cloth. To prevent their being scratched, keep
  tea-boards and trays in green baize cases, under the dresser of the pantry, or, if convenient,
  hung against the wall, to be out of the way, when not in use.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Plate, plain, handsome, old or new, looks badly, if not perfectly clean and
  polished. Washing is of great consequence; and if in cold soft water, wiped dry with a linen
  cloth, and then polished with leather, it will not want any other cleaning oftener than once a
  week. Unskilful <span class="pagenum" id="page21">{21}</span>servants may do great injury by using
  improper things to polish plate, or by rubbing it too hard, for that may bend it. Plate should be
  kept covered up, when not in use, to preserve it from tarnish. Tea pots, coffee pots, sugar bowls,
  cream jugs, candlesticks, and all large things, each in a separate bag of cloth, baize, or
  leather; a lined basket for that which is in daily use, preserves it from scratches. Where there
  is neither butler, nor housekeeper, to take charge of it, the mistress of the house usually has
  the plate basket taken at night into her own room, or that of some one of the family, where it
  may, occasionally, be looked over and compared with the inventory, kept in the basket. If a spoon
  or any article be missing, it should be immediately inquired after; the effect of this will be
  that the servant who has the care of these things will take more care of them for the future. It
  has happened to us to have spoons found, at different times, in the pig-sty, which had been thrown
  out in the wash. If they had not been discovered there, the servant, who was only careless, might
  have been suspected of dishonesty.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To clean Plate.</i></p>

  <p>Having ready two leathers, and a soft plate brush for crevices, and the plate being washed
  clean, which it always should be first, rub it with a mixture of prepared chalk, bought at the
  chemist's, and spirits of wine; let it dry, rub it off with flannel, and polish with leather. I
  find this the best way of all.</p>

  <p>Much of the labour necessary to keep tables in good order might be saved, if mats were used,
  when jugs of hot water are placed on the table; and, also, if the servant were brought to apply a
  duster, the instant any accident had occurred to cause a stain. For this purpose a clean and white
  duster should always be in readiness. Rosewood and all polished, japanned, or other ornamental
  furniture, is best <i>dusted</i> with a silk handkerchief, and wiped with a soft leather. China
  and all ornaments dusted with clean leathers.</p>

  <p>So little furniture is now used which is not <i>French polished</i>, that I shall only give the
  plainest receipt I know of, for cleaning mahogany. Take out ink spots with salts of lemon; wet the
  spot with water, put on enough to cover it, let it be a quarter of an hour, and if not
  disappeared, put <span class="pagenum" id="page22">{22}</span>a little more. Wash the table clean
  with stale beer, let it dry, then brush it well with a clean furniture brush. To polish it, use
  the following <span class="sc">Furniture Paste</span>:&mdash; lb. beeswax, turpentine to moisten
  it, <i>or</i> spirits of wine, melt it, stirring well, and put by in a jar for use. Rub some on
  with a soft cloth, rub it off directly, and polish with another soft cloth.</p>

  <p>Nothing betrays slovenliness and want of attention more than ill-used and badly cleaned knives
  and forks. Plate, glass and china, however common, may be made to answer every purpose; but knives
  and forks ought to be good in quality, or they soon wear out, and nothing looks so bad on a table
  as bad knives and forks, and when good they are so expensive that it is unpardonable not to take
  care of them. Carving knives are of great consequence; there should be a judicious assortment of
  them, to suit various joints, or different carvers, and particular attention paid to their
  cleaning and sharpening. When it can be done, knives and forks should be cleaned immediately after
  they have been used; but when not, they ought, if possible, to be dipped in warm (not hot) water,
  wiped dry, and laid by till the time of cleaning comes. After bath brick has been used, dip the
  handles into lukewarm water, or wipe them with a soaped flannel, and then with a dry soft cloth.
  Inexperienced men servants seldom <i>wipe</i> knives and forks sufficiently; but it is next to
  impossible for a woman to clean them well, and it is a masculine occupation. To preserve those not
  in daily use from rust, rub with mutton fat, roll each one in brown paper, and keep in a dry
  place. A good knife-board indispensable; covered with leather saves the steel, but the knives not
  so sharp as if cleaned on a board, and bath brick. Both knives and forks are the better for being
  occasionally plunged into fresh fine earth, for a few minutes. It sweetens them.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Knife-trays do not always have so much care as they ought to have. Out of sight
  when in the dining-room, they are often neglected in the pantry; but they ought to be as clean as
  the waiters on which glasses are handed. The tray made of basket work and lined with tin, is best;
  there should be a clean cloth spread in it, before it is brought into the parlour, and also one in
  the second tray to receive the knives and forks, as they are taken from the table.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="IV. The Larder" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER IV.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE LARDER.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">A good</span> larder is essential to every house. It should have a free
  circulation of air through it, and not be exposed to the sun. If it can be so contrived, the
  larder ought to be near the kitchen, for the convenience of the cook. For a family of moderate
  style of living it need not be very roomy. There should be large and strong hooks for meat and
  poultry; a hanging shelf so placed as for the cook to reach it with ease; and a safe, either
  attached to the wall, or upon a stand, for dishes of cold meat, pastry, or anything which would be
  exposed to dust and flies on the shelf. Wire covers should be provided for this purpose, and in
  hot weather, when it may be necessary to place dishes of meat on a brick floor, these covers will
  be found to answer every purpose of a safe. There should be a pan, with a cover, for bread,
  another for butter, and one for cheese. A shelf for common earthenware bowls, dishes, &amp;c.,
  &amp;c., &amp;c. Cold meat, and all things left from the dinner, should be put away in common
  brown or yellow ware; there ought to be an ample supply of these. Tubs and pans for salted meat
  sometimes stand in the dairy, but it is not the proper place for them, for meat ought not to be
  kept in a dairy.</p>

  <p>Meat should be examined every day in cold, and oftener in warm weather, as it sometimes taints
  very soon. Scrape off the outside, if the least appearance of mould, on mutton, beef, or venison;
  and flour the scraped parts. By well peppering meat you may keep away flies, which cause so much
  destruction in a short time. But a very coarse cheese-cloth, wrapped round the joint, is more
  effectual, if the meat is to be dressed soon. Remove the kidneys, and all the suet, from loins
  which are wanted to hang long, in warm or close weather, and carefully wipe and flour that part of
  the meat. Before you put meat which is rather stale to the fire, wipe it with a cloth dipped in
  vinegar. A <span class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}</span>joint of beef, mutton, or venison, may be
  saved by being wrapped in a cloth and buried, over night, in a hole dug in fresh mould. Neither
  veal, pork, or lamb should be kept long.</p>

  <p>Poultry and game keep for some length of time, if the weather be dry and cold, but if moist or
  warm, will be more liable to taint, than venison or any kind of meat, except veal. A piece of
  charcoal put inside of any kind of poultry will greatly assist to preserve it. Poultry should be
  picked, drawn and cropped. Do not wash, but wipe it clean, and sprinkle the parts most likely to
  taint with powdered loaf sugar, salt, and pepper. As I should reject the use of all chemical
  processes, for the preservation of meat, I do not recommend them to others.</p>

  <p>Frost has a great effect upon meat, poultry, and game. Some cooks will not be persuaded of the
  necessity for its being completely <i>thawed before it is put near the fire</i>; yet it neither
  roasts, boils, nor eats well, unless this be done. If slightly frozen, the meat may be recovered,
  by being five or six hours in the kitchen; <i>not</i> near the fire. Another method is, to plunge
  a joint into a tub of <i>cold</i> water, let it remain two or three hours, or even longer, and the
  ice will appear on the outside. Meat should be cooked immediately after it has been thawed, for it
  will keep no longer.</p>

  <p class="sp4">If the tastes of all persons were simple and unvitiated, there would be little
  occasion for the cook's ingenuity to preserve meat after it has begun to putrefy. An objection to
  meat in that state, does not arise merely from distaste, but from a conviction of its being most
  unwholesome. There may have been a difference of opinion among the scientific upon this subject:
  but, it seems now to be generally considered by those who best understand such matters, that when
  meat has become poisonous to the air, it is no longer good and nutritious food. The fashion of
  eating meat <i> la cannibale</i>, or half raw, being happily on the decline, we may now venture
  to express our dislike to eat things which are half decomposed, without incurring the charge of
  vulgarity.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">SALTING AND CURING MEAT.</span></p>

  <p>The Counties of England differ materially in their modes of curing bacon and pork; but the palm
  of excellency in <span class="pagenum" id="page25">{25}</span>bacon has so long been decreed to
  Hampshire, that I shall give no other receipts for it, but such as are practised in that, and the
  adjoining counties. The best method of keeping, feeding, and killing pigs, is detailed in <span
  class="sc">Cobbett</span>'s <i>Cottage Economy</i>; and there, also, will be found directions for
  salting and smoking the flitches, in the way commonly practised in the farm-houses in Hampshire.
  The <i>smoking</i> of bacon is an important affair, and experience is requisite to give any thing
  like perfection in the art. The process should not be too slow nor too much hurried. The skin
  should be made of a dark brown colour, but not black; for by smoking the bacon till it becomes
  black, it will also be made hard, and cease to have any flavour but that of rust.&mdash;Before
  they are dressed, both bacon and hams require to be soaked in water; the former an hour or two,
  the latter, all night, or longer, if very dry. But, according to some, the best way to soak a ham
  is to bury it in the earth, for one, two, or three nights and days, according to its state of
  dryness.</p>

  <p>Meat will not take salt well either in frosty or in warm weather. Every thing depends upon the
  first rubbing; and the salt, or pickle, should not only be well rubbed in, but this is best done
  by a hard hand. The following general direction for salting meat may be relied on:&mdash;"6 lbs.
  of salt, 1 lb. of coarse sugar, and 4 oz. of saltpetre, boiled in 4 gallons of water, skimmed and
  allowed to cool, forms a very strong pickle, which will preserve any meat completely immersed in
  it. To effect this, which is essential, either a heavy board or flat stone must be laid upon the
  meat. The same pickle may be used repeatedly, provided it be boiled up occasionally with
  additional salt to restore its strength, diminished by the combination of part of the salt with
  the meat, and by the dilution of the pickle by the juices of the meat extracted. By boiling, the
  <i>albumen</i>, which would cause the pickle to spoil, is coagulated and rises in the form of
  scum, which must be carefully removed."</p>

  <p>It is a good practice to wash meat before it is salted. This is not generally done; but pieces
  of pork, and, more particularly, beef and tongues, should first lie in cold spring water, and then
  be well washed to cleanse them from all impurities, in order to ensure their being free from
  taint; after which, drain the meat, and it will take the salt much <span class="pagenum"
  id="page26">{26}</span>quicker for the washing.&mdash;Examine it well; and be careful to take all
  the kernels out of beef.</p>

  <p>Some persons like salted meat to be red. For this purpose, saltpetre is necessary. Otherwise,
  the less use is made of it the better, as it tends to harden the meat. Sweet herbs, spices, and
  even garlic, may be rubbed into hams and tongues, with the pickle, according to taste. Bay salt
  gives a nice flavour. Sugar is generally used in curing hams, tongues and beef; for the two latter
  some recommend lump sugar, others treacle, to make the meat eat short.</p>

  <p>In cold weather salt should be warmed before the fire. Indeed, some use it quite hot. This
  causes it to penetrate more readily into the meat than it does when rendered hard and dry by
  frost.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Salting troughs or tubs should be clean, and in an airy place. After meat of any
  kind has been once well rubbed, keep it covered close, not only with the lid of the vessel, but,
  in addition, with the thick folds of some woollen article, in order to exclude the air. This is
  recommended by good housekeepers; yet in Hampshire the trough is sometimes left uncovered, the
  flitches purposely exposed to the air.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To cure Bacon.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">As soon as the hog is cut up, sprinkle salt thickly over the flitches, and let them
  lie on a brick floor all night. Then wipe the salt off, and lay them in a salting trough. For a
  large flitch of bacon, allow 2 gallons of salt, 1 lb. of bay salt, 4 cakes of salt prunella, a 
  lb. of saltpetre, and 1 lb. of common moist sugar; divide this mixture into two parts; rub one
  half into it the first day, and rub it in <i>well</i>. The following day rub the other half in,
  and continue to rub and turn the flitch every day for three weeks. Then hang the flitches to
  drain, roll them in bran, and hang them to smoke, in a wood-fire chimney. The more quickly, in
  reason, they are smoked, the better the bacon will taste.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To cure a Ham.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Let a leg of pork hang for three days; then beat it with a rolling pin, and rub
  into it 1 oz. of saltpetre finely <span class="pagenum" id="page27">{27}</span>powdered, and mixed
  with a small quantity of common salt; let it lie all night. Make the following pickle: a quart of
  stale strong beer,  lb. of bay salt,  lb. of common salt, and the same of brown sugar; boil this
  twenty minutes, then wipe the ham dry from the salt, and with a wooden ladle, pour the pickle, by
  degrees, and as hot as possible, over the ham; and as it cools, rub it well into every part. Rub
  and turn it every day, for a week; then hang it, a fortnight, in a wood-smoke chimney. When you
  take it down, sprinkle black pepper over the bone, and into the holes, to keep it safe from
  hoppers, and hang it up in a thick paper bag.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">For one of 16 lb. weight. Rub the rind side of the ham with  lb. of brown sugar,
  then rub it with 1 lb. of salt, and put it in the salting-pan, then rub a little of the sugar, and
  1 oz. of saltpetre, and 1 oz. salt prunel, pounded, on the lean side, and press it down; in three
  days turn it and rub it well with the salt in the pan, then turn it in the pickle for three weeks;
  take it out, scrape it well, dry it with a clean cloth, rub it slightly with a little salt, and
  hang it up to dry.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beat the ham well on the fleshy side with a rolling pin, then rub into it, on every
  part, 1 oz. of saltpetre, and let it lie one night. Then take a  pint of common salt, and a 
  pint of bay salt, and 1 lb. of coarse sugar or treacle; mix these ingredients, and make them very
  hot in a stew-pan, and rub in well for an hour. Then take  a pint more of common salt and lay all
  over the ham, and let it lie on till it melts to brine; keep the ham in the pickle three weeks or
  a month, till you see it shrink. This is sufficient for a large ham.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another, said to be equal to the Westphalian.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Rub a large fat ham well, with 2 oz. of pounded saltpetre, 1 oz. of bay salt, and a
   lb. of lump sugar: let it lie two days. Prepare a pickle as follows: boil in 2 quarts <span
  class="pagenum" id="page28">{28}</span>of stale ale, 1 lb. of bay salt, 2 lb. of common salt, 
  lb. of lump sugar, 2 oz. of salt prunella, 1 oz. of pounded black pepper, and  an oz. of cloves;
  boil this well, and pour it boiling hot over the ham. Rub and turn it every day for three weeks or
  a month; then smoke it for about a fortnight.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To cure a Mutton Ham.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">A hind quarter must be cut into the shape of a ham: rub into it the following
  mixture:  lb. saltpetre,  lb. bay salt, 1 lb. common salt, and  lb. loaf sugar; rub well, every
  other day, for a fortnight, then take it out, press it under a weight for one day, then hang it to
  smoke ten or fifteen days. It will require long soaking, if kept any length of time, before it is
  dressed. Boil very gently, three hours. It is eaten cut in slices, and these broiled for breakfast
  or lunch.&mdash;<i>Or</i>; the ham smoked longer, not boiled, but slices very thinly shaved to eat
  by way of relish at breakfast.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To pickle Pork.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">For a hog of 10 score.&mdash;When it is quite cold, and cut up in pieces, have well
  mixed 2 gallons of common salt, and 1 lb. of saltpetre; with this, rub well each piece of pork,
  and as you rub, pack it in a salting tub, and sprinkle salt between each layer. Put a heavy weight
  on the top of the cover, to prevent the meat's swimming. If kept close and tight in this way, it
  will keep for a year or two.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Leg of Pork.</i></p>

  <p>Proceed as above, salt in proportion, but leave out the saltpetre if you choose. The hand and
  <i>spring</i> also, in the same way&mdash;and a week sufficient for either. Rub and turn them
  every day.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Pig's Head</i> in the same way, but it will require two weeks.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To pickle a Tongue.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Rub the tongue over with common salt; and cut a slit in the root, so that the salt
  may penetrate. Drain the tongue next day, and rub it over with 2 oz. of bay salt, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page29">{29}</span>2 oz. of saltpetre, and 2 oz. of lump or coarse sugar, all
  mixed together. This pickle should be poured over the tongue, with a spoon, every day, as there
  will not be sufficient liquor to cover it. It will be ready to dress in three weeks or a
  month.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To salt Beef.</i></p>

  <p>Be sure to take out the <i>kernels</i>, and also be sure to fill up the holes with salt, as
  well as those which the butcher's skewers have made. In frosty weather, take care that the meat be
  not frozen; also, to warm the salt before the fire, or in a frying pan.</p>

  <p class="sp3">For a piece of 20 lb. weight.&mdash;Sprinkle the meat with salt, and let it lie
  twenty-four hours; then hang it up to drain. Take 1 oz. of saltpetre, a  oz. of salt prunella, a
   lb. of very coarse sugar, 6 oz. of common salt, all finely powdered, and rub it well into the
  beef. Rub and turn it every day. It will be ready to dress in ten days, but may be kept
  longer.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To salt a Round of Beef.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">For one of 30 lb. weight.&mdash;Rub common salt well into it all over and in every
  part, cover it well with salt: rub it well next day, pouring the brine over the meat. Repeat this
  every day for a fortnight, when it will be ready. Let it drain for 15 minutes, when you are going
  to cook it. You may, if you wish it to look red, add 4 oz. salt prunel, and 1 lb. saltpetre to the
  pickle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>An Edge Bone.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To one of 10 or 12 lb. weight allow  lb. of salt, and 1 oz. of moist sugar. Rub
  these well into the meat. Repeat the rubbing every day, turning the meat also, and it will be
  ready to dress in four or five days.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tongue Beef.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">After the tongues are taken out of the pickle, wash and wipe dry a piece of flank
  or brisket of beef; sprinkle with salt, and let it lie a night; then hang it to drain, rub in a
  <span class="pagenum" id="page30">{30}</span>little fresh salt, and put the beef into the pickle;
  rub and turn it every day for three or four days, and it will be ready to dress, and if the pickle
  have been previously well prepared, will be found to have a very fine flavour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To smoke Beef.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut a round into pieces of 5 lb. weight each, and salt them very well; when
  sufficiently salted, hang the pieces in a wood-smoke chimney to dry, and let them hang three or
  four weeks. This may be grated, for breakfast or luncheon. <i>Another.</i>&mdash;Cut a leg of beef
  like a ham, and to one of 14 lb. make a pickle of 1 lb. salt, 1 lb. brown sugar, 1 oz. saltpetre,
  and 1 oz. bay salt. Rub and turn the ham every day for a month, then roll it in bran and smoke it.
  Hang it in a dry place. Broil it in slices.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To make pickle for Brawn.</i></p>

  <p>To rather more than a sufficient quantity of water to cover it, put 7 or 8 handsful of bran, a
  few bay leaves, also salt enough to give a strong relish; boil this an hour and a half, then
  strain it. When cold, pour the pickle from the sediment into a pan, and put the meat into it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Any of these pickles may be used again. First boil it up and take off all the
  scum.</p>

  VEGETABLES.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">It</span> is always the best plan to deal with a respectable butcher, and to
  keep to the same one. He will find his interest in providing his regular customers with good meat,
  and the <i>best</i> is always the <i>cheapest</i>, even though it may cost a little more
  money.</p>

  <p><i>Beef</i> is best and cheapest from Michaelmas to Midsummer.</p>

  <p><i>Veal</i> is best and cheapest from March to July.</p>

  <p><i>Mutton</i> is best from Christmas to Midsummer.</p>

  <p><i>Grass Lamb</i> is best from Easter to June.</p>

  <p><i>House Lamb</i> comes in in February.</p>

  <p><i>Poultry</i> is in the greatest perfection, when it is in the greatest plenty, which it is
  about September.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page31">{31}</span></div>

  <p><i>Chickens</i> come in the beginning of April, but they may be had all the year round.</p>

  <p><i>Fowls</i> are dearest in April, May, and June, but they may be had all the year round, and
  are cheapest in September, October, and November.</p>

  <p><i>Capons</i> are finest at Christmas.</p>

  <p><i>Poulards</i>, with <i>eggs</i>, come in in March.</p>

  <p><i>Green Geese</i> come in in March, and continue till September.</p>

  <p><i>Geese</i> are in full season in September, and continue till February.</p>

  <p><i>Turkey Poults</i> come in in April, and continue till June.</p>

  <p><i>Turkeys</i> are in season from September till March, and are cheapest in October and
  November.</p>

  <p><i>Ducks</i> are in season from June till February.</p>

  <p><i>Wild Ducks</i>, <i>Widgeons</i>, <i>Teal</i>, <i>Plovers</i>, <i>Pintails</i>, <i>Larks</i>,
  <i>Snipes</i>, <i>Woodcocks</i>, from the end of October till the end of March.</p>

  <p><i>Tame Pigeons</i> are in season all the year, <i>Wild Pigeons</i> from March till
  September.</p>

  <p><i>Pea-Fowl</i> (young ones) from January till June.</p>

  <p><i>Partridges</i> from 1st September till January.</p>

  <p><i>Pheasants</i> from 1st October till January.</p>

  <p><i>Grouse</i> from the 12th of August till Christmas, also <i>Black Cocks</i> and <i>Grey
  Hens</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Guinea Fowls</i> from the end of January till May; their eggs are much more delicate than
  common ones.</p>

  <p><i>Hares</i> from September to March.</p>

  <p><i>Leverets</i> from March to September.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Rabbits</i> all the year round.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fish.</i></p>

  <p>The seasons of Fish frequently vary; therefore the surest way to have it good is to confide in
  the honesty of respectable fishmongers; unless, indeed, you are well acquainted with the several
  sorts, and have frequent practice in the choosing of it. No fish when out of season can be
  wholesome food.</p>

  <p><i>Turbot</i> is in season from September to May. Fish of this kind do not all spawn at the
  same time; therefore, there are good as well as bad all the year round. The finest are brought
  from the Dutch coast. The belly of a Turbot <span class="pagenum" id="page32">{32}</span>should be
  cream coloured, and upon pressing your finger on this part, it should spring up. A Turbot eats the
  better for being kept two or three days. Where there is any apprehension of its not keeping, a
  little salt may be sprinkled on it, and the fish hung in a cool dry place.</p>

  <p><i>Salmon.</i>&mdash;This favourite fish is the most unwholesome of all. It ought never to be
  eaten unless perfectly fresh, and in season. Salmon is in season from Christmas till September.
  The Severn Salmon, indeed, is in season in November, but it is then obtained only in small
  quantities. This, and the Thames Salmon, are considered the best. That which comes from Scotland,
  packed in ice, is not so good. <i>Salmon Peel</i> are very nice flavoured, but much less rich than
  large Salmon; come in June.</p>

  <p><i>Cod</i> is in perfection at Christmas; but it comes in, generally, in October; in the months
  of February and March it is poor, but in April and May it becomes finer. The Dogger Bank Cod are
  considered the best. Good Cod fish are known by the yellow spots on a pure white skin. In cold
  weather they will keep a day or two.</p>

  <p><i>Skate</i>, <i>Haddocks</i>, <i>Soles</i>, <i>Plaice</i>, and <i>Flounders</i> are in season
  in January, as well as <i>Smelts</i> and <i>Prawns</i>. In February, <i>Lobsters</i> and
  <i>Herrings</i> become more plentiful; <i>Haddocks</i> not in such good flavour as they were. In
  March <i>Salmon</i> becomes plentiful, but is still dear. And in this month the <i>John Dory</i>
  comes in.</p>

  <p>In April <i>Smelts</i> and <i>Whiting</i> are plentiful; and <i>Mackerel</i> and <i>Mullet</i>
  come in; also river <i>Trout</i>.</p>

  <p>In May <i>Oysters</i> go out of season, and <i>Cod</i> becomes not so good; excepting these,
  all the fish that was in season at Christmas, is in perfection in this month.</p>

  <p>In June <i>Salmon</i>, <i>Turbot</i>, <i>Brill</i>, <i>Skate</i>, <i>Halibut</i>,
  <i>Lobsters</i>, <i>Crabs</i>, <i>Prawns</i>, <i>Soles</i>, <i>Eels</i> and <i>Whiting</i> are
  plentiful and cheap. Middling sized Lobsters are best, and must weigh heavy to be good. The best
  Crabs measure about eight inches across the shoulders. The silver eel is the best, and, next to
  that, the copper-brown backed eel. A humane method of putting this fish to death is to run a
  sharp-pointed skewer or fine knitting needle into the spinal marrow, through the back part of the
  skin, and life will instantly cease.</p>

  <p>In July fish of all sorts plentiful, except Oysters, and about at the cheapest. Cod not in much
  estimation.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page33">{33}</span></div>

  <p>In the months of August and September, particularly the former, fish is considered more
  decidedly unwholesome than at any other time of the year, and more especially in London.
  <i>Oysters</i> come in, and <i>Turbot</i> and <i>Salmon</i> go out of season. In choosing Oysters,
  natives are best; they should be eaten as soon after they are opened as possible. There are
  various ways of <i>keeping</i> and <i>feeding</i> oysters, for which see Index.</p>

  <p>In October <i>Cod</i> comes in good season, also <i>Haddocks</i>, <i>Brill</i>, <i>Tench</i>,
  and every sort of shell fish.</p>

  <p>In November most sorts of fish are to be got, but all are dear. <i>Oysters</i> are excellent in
  this month.</p>

  <p><i>Fresh Herrings</i> from November to January.</p>

  <p><i>River Eels</i> all the year.</p>

  <p><i>Red Mullet</i> come in May.</p>

  <p><i>Flounders</i> and <i>Plaice</i> in June.</p>

  <p><i>Sprats</i> beginning of November.</p>

  <p><i>Gurnet</i> is best in the spring.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE KITCHEN.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">The</span> benefit of a good kitchen is well known to every housekeeper, but
  it is not every mistress that is aware of the importance of having a good cook. I have seen
  kitchens which, though fitted up with every convenience, and certainly at considerable expense,
  yet failed to send forth good dinners, merely because the lady of the house was not happy in her
  choice of a cook. I do not in the least admire gourmands, or gourmandism; and yet I would be more
  particular in selecting the servant who is to perform the business of preparing the food of the
  family, than I should deem it necessary to be in selecting any of the other servants. In large
  establishments there is a greater quantity of cookery to be performed, and, consequently, a
  greater quantity of waste is likely to be caused by unskilful cooks, than there can be in small
  families; but even in the latter considerable waste may be the consequence of saving a few pounds
  a year in the wages of a cook. An experienced cook knows the value of the articles submitted to
  her care; and she knows how to turn many things to account which a person unacquainted with
  cooking would throw away. A good cook knows how to convert the remains of one dinner into various
  dishes to form the greater part of another dinner; and she will, also, be more capable than the
  other of forwarding her mistress's charitable intentions; for her capability in cooking will
  enable her to take advantage of everything which can be spared from the consumption of the family,
  to be converted into nourishing food for the poor, for those of her own class who have not the
  comfort of a home such as she herself enjoys. The cook who knows how to preserve the pot-liquor of
  fresh meat to make soup, will, whenever she boils mutton, fowls, or rabbits, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
  carefully scum it, and, by adding peas, other vegetables, or crusts of bread, and proper
  seasonings, make some tolerable soup for poor <span class="pagenum" id="page36">{36}</span>people,
  out of materials which would otherwise be thrown away.</p>

  <p>To be a good cook she must take pleasure in her occupation; for the requisite painstaking
  cannot be expected from a person who dislikes the fire, or who entertains a disgust for the
  various processes necessary to convert meat into savoury dishes. But a cook who takes pride in
  sending a dinner well dressed to table, may be <i>depended upon</i>, and that is of great
  importance to the mistress of a house: for though Englishmen may not be such connoisseurs in
  eating as Frenchmen, I question whether French husbands are more dissatisfied with a badly-cooked
  dinner than English husbands are. Dr. <span class="sc">Kitchener</span> observes, "God sends us
  victuals, but <i>who</i> sends us cooks?" And the observation is not confined to the Doctor, for
  the walls of many a dining-room have echoed it, to the great discomfiture of the lady presiding at
  the head of the table. Ladies might, if they would, be obliged to confess that many ill humours
  had been occasioned by either under or over roasted meat, cold plates, or blunt knives; and
  perhaps these <i>are</i> grounds for complaint. Of the same importance as the cooking is neatness
  in serving the dinner, for there is a vast difference in its appearance if neatly and properly
  arranged in hot dishes, the vegetables and sauces suitable to the meat, and <i>hot</i>&mdash;there
  is a vast difference between a dinner so served, and one a part of which is either too much or too
  little cooked, the meat parting from the bone in one case, or looking as if barely warmed through
  in the other case; the gravy chilled and turning to grease, some of the vegetables watery, and
  others crisped, while the edges of the dishes are slopped, and the block-tin covers look dull. A
  leg of mutton or piece of beef, either boiled or roasted&mdash;so commonly the dinner of a
  plain-living family&mdash;requires as much skill and nicety as the most complicated made dishes;
  and a plain dinner well cooked and served is as tempting to the appetite as it is creditable to
  the mistress of the house, who invariably suffers in the estimation of her guests for the want of
  ability in her servants. The elegance of the drawing-room they have just left is forgotten by
  those who are suffocating from the over-peppered soup; and the coldness of the plate on which is
  handed a piece of turbot bearing a reddish hue, may hold a place in the memory of a visitor, to
  <span class="pagenum" id="page37">{37}</span>the total obliteration of the winning graces, and
  agreeable conversation, of the lady at the head of the table.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to give particular directions for fitting up a kitchen, because so much must
  depend upon the number of servants, and upon what is required in the way of cookery. It was the
  fashion formerly to adorn it with a quantity of copper saucepans, stewpans, &amp;c., &amp;c., very
  expensive, and troublesome to keep clean. Many of these articles, which were regularly scoured
  once a week, were not, perhaps, used once in the year. A young lady ought, if she has a good cook,
  to be guided by her, in some measure, in the purchase of kitchen utensils; for the accommodation
  of the cook, if she be a reasonable person, ought to be consulted. But, where there is no
  kitchen-maid to clean them, the fewer coppers and tins the better. It is the best plan to buy, at
  first, only just enough for use, and to replace these with new ones as they wear out; but all
  stewpans, saucepans, frying-pans, &amp;c., &amp;c., should be kept in good order&mdash;that is to
  say, clean and in good repair.</p>

  <p>Some of the best cooks say that iron and block tin answer every purpose. There is an useful,
  but somewhat expensive, article, called the <i>Bain-marie</i>, for heating made dishes and soups,
  and keeping them hot for any length of time, without over-cooking them. A <i>Bain-marie</i> will
  be found very useful to persons who are in the habit of having made dishes. A <i>braising</i>
  kettle and a <i>stock-pot</i> also; and two or three cast-iron <i>Digesters</i>, of from one to
  two gallons, for soups and gravies. Saucepans should be washed and scoured as soon as possible
  after they have been used: wood ashes, or very fine sand, may be used. They should be rinsed in
  clean water, wiped dry (or they will rust), and then be turned down on a clean shelf. The upper
  rim may be kept bright, but it seems labour lost to scour that part where the fire reaches;
  besides which, the more they are scoured the more quickly they wear out. Copper utensils must be
  well tinned, or they become poisonous. Never allow anything to be put by in a copper vessel; but
  the fatal consequences of neglect in this particular are too well known for it to be necessary
  here to say much in the way of caution.</p>

  <p>The fire-place is a matter of great importance. I have not witnessed the operations of many of
  the steam cooking apparatuses, which the last thirty years have produced, but <span
  class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span>the few I have seen do not give me satisfaction. It is
  certainly desirable that every <i>possible</i> saving should be made in the consumption of coals;
  but it is <i>not possible</i> to have cooking in perfection, without a proper degree of heat; and,
  as far as my observation has gone, meat cannot be well roasted unless before a good fire. I should
  save in many things rather than in coals; and am often puzzled to account for the false economy
  which leads persons to be sparing of their fuel, whilst they are lavish in other things infinitely
  less essential. A cook has many trials of her temper, but none so difficult to bear as the
  annoyance of a bad fire; for she cannot cook her dinner well, however much she may fret herself in
  the endeavour; and the waste caused by spoiling meat, fish, poultry, game, &amp;c., is scarcely
  made up for by saving a few shillings in coals. "Economy in fuel" is so popular, that every
  species of invention is resorted to, in order to go without fire; and the price of coals is talked
  of in a fine drawing room, where the shivering guest turns, and often in vain, to seek comfort
  from the fire, which, alas! the brightly polished grate does not contain. The beauty of the cold
  marble structure which rises above it, and is reflected in the opposite mirror, is a poor
  compensation for the want of warmth. I advise young housekeepers to bear in mind, that of the many
  things which may be saved in a house, without lessening its comforts, firing is <i>not</i>
  one.</p>

  <p>It is best to lay in coals in the month of August or September, to last until the spring. They
  should be of the best kind; paid for in ready money, to prevent an additional charge for credit.
  The first year of housekeeping will give a pretty correct average to go by: and then the
  consumption should be watched, but not too rigidly.</p>

  <p>To return to the fire-place.&mdash;Perhaps there is no apparatus more convenient for a family
  of moderate style of living than the common kitchen range, that which has a boiler for hot water
  on one side, and an oven on the other side. It is a great convenience to have a constant supply of
  hot water, and an advantage to possess the means of baking a pie, pudding, or cake; and this may
  always be done, when there is a large fire for boiling or roasting. There is a great difference in
  the construction of these little ovens. We have had several, and only three which <span
  class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>answered; and these were all, I believe, by different
  makers.&mdash;A <i>Hot plate</i> is also an excellent thing, as it requires but little fire to
  keep it sufficiently hot for any thing requiring gradual cooking; and is convenient for making
  preserves, which should never be exposed to the fierceness of a fire. The charcoal stoves are
  useful, and so easily constructed that a kitchen should not be without one. There is a very nice
  thing, called a <i>Dutch Stove</i>, but I do not know whether it is much in use in England. On a
  rather solid frame-work, with four legs, about a foot from the ground, is raised a round
  brick-work, open at the top sufficiently deep to receive charcoal, and in the front, a little
  place to take out the ashes; on the top is a trivet, upon which the stew-pan, or preserving-pan,
  or whatever it may be, is placed. This is easily moved about, and in the summer could be placed
  anywhere in the cool, and would, therefore, be very convenient for making preserves.&mdash;Where
  there is much cooking, a <i>Steamer</i> is convenient; it may be attached to the boiler of the
  range. I have seen lamb and mutton which had been steamed, and which in appearance was more
  delicate than when boiled, and equally well flavoured. But there is an <i>uncertainty</i> in
  cooking meat by steam, and, besides, there is no liquor for soup. Puddings cook well by
  steam.&mdash;The <i>Jack</i> is an article of great consequence, and also a troublesome one, being
  frequently out of repair. A <i>Bottle-jack</i> answers very well for a small family; and where
  there is a good <i>meat screen</i> (which is indispensable), a stout nail and a skein of worsted
  will, provided the cook be not called away from the kitchen, be found to answer the purpose of a
  spit.</p>

  <p>There are now so many excellent weighing-machines, of simple construction, that there ought to
  be one in every kitchen, to weigh joints of meat as they come from the butcher, and this will
  enable the cook to weigh flour, butter, sugar, spices, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The cook should be allowed a sufficiency of kitchen cloths and brushes, suitable to her work.
  Plates and dishes will not look clear and bright unless rinsed in clean water, after they are
  washed, then drained, and wiped dry with a cloth which is not greasy. A handful of bran in the
  water will produce a fine polish on crockery ware.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page40">{40}</span></div>

  <p>As they do not cost much, there need be no hesitation to allow plenty of jelly-bags, straining
  cloths, tapes, &amp;c. &amp;c. These should be very clean, and scalded in hot water before they
  are used.</p>

  <p>There should be a table in the middle of the kitchen, or so situated as not to be exposed to a
  current of air, to arrange the dishes upon, that blunders may not be committed in placing them
  upon the dining-table. Much of the pleasure which the lady at the head of her table may feel at
  seeing her guests around her, is destroyed by the awkward mistakes of servants in waiting; who,
  when they discover that they have done wrong, frequently become too frightened and confused to
  repair the error they have committed.</p>

  <p>The cook in a small family should have charge of the beer; and where there are no men servants,
  it should be rather good than weak, for the better in quality, the more care will be taken of it.
  When more is drawn than is wanted, a burnt crust will keep it fresh from one meal to another, but
  for a longer time it should be put into a bottle, and corked close; it would be well for the cook
  to keep a few different sized bottles, so that the beer may not stand to become flat before she
  bottle it.</p>

  <p>A clock, in or near the kitchen, will tend to promote punctuality. But the lady herself should
  see to its being regulated, or this piece of furniture may do more harm than good. There is
  nothing fitter to be under lock and key than the clock, for, however true to time, when not
  interfered with, it is often made to bear false testimony. That good understanding which sometimes
  subsists between the clock and the cook, and which is brought about by the instrumentality of a
  broom-handle, or some such magic, should be noted by every prudent housekeeper as one of the
  things to be guarded against.</p>

  <p>The kitchen chimney should be frequently swept; besides which, the cook should, once or twice a
  week, sweep it as far as she can reach; for where there are large fires in old houses, accidents
  sometimes occur; and the falling of ever so little soot will sometimes spoil a dinner.</p>

  <p>Every lady ought to make a receipt-book for herself. Neither my receipts nor those of any
  cookery book can be supposed to give equal satisfaction to every palate. After <span
  class="pagenum" id="page41">{41}</span>performing any piece of cookery according to the directions
  given in a book, a person of common intelligence would be able to discover whatever was
  displeasing to the taste, and easily alter the receipt, and so enter it in her own book that the
  cook could not err in following it. This plan would be found to save much trouble.</p>

  <p>As soon after breakfast as she conveniently can, the mistress of a house should repair to the
  kitchen; which ought to be swept, the fire-place cleaned, tea-kettles, coffee-pots, and anything
  else used in preparing the breakfast, put in their appropriate places, and the cook ready to
  receive her orders for the day. Without being parsimonious, the mistress should see, with her own
  eyes, every morning, whatever cold meat, remains of pastry, bread, butter, &amp;c., &amp;c., there
  may be in the larder, that she may be able to judge of the additional provision required. Having
  done that, she should proceed to the store-room, to give the cook, the housemaid, and others, such
  stores as they may require for the day. This will occupy but very little time, if done regularly
  every morning; and having done this, she should proceed to make her purchases at once, lest
  visitors, or any accidental circumstance, cause her to be late in her marketing, and so derange
  the regularity of the dinner hour, the servants' work, &amp;c., &amp;c. Many ladies, in
  consequence of their own ill health, or that of their children, are compelled to employ their
  servants to market for them; but when they can avoid doing so it is better. I do not say this from
  a suspicion that either tradespeople or servants are always likely to take advantage of an
  opportunity to impose upon their customers or their employers, but because this important part of
  household management ought to be conducted by some one of the family, who must necessarily be more
  interested in it than servants can be. Besides, more judgment is required in marketing than all
  servants possess. A servant, for instance, is sent to a fishmonger's for a certain quantity of
  fish, and she obeys the order given her and brings home the fish, but at a higher price, perhaps,
  than her mistress expected. Now if the lady had gone herself, and found that the weather, or any
  other circumstance, had raised the price of fish for that day, she would probably have made a less
  expensive one suit her purpose, or turned to the Butcher or Poulterer to supply her table. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page42">{42}</span>Also it is a hindrance to a servant to be sent here and
  there during the early part of the day, not to mention the benefit which the lady of the house
  would derive by being compelled to be out of doors, and in exercise, for even a short time, every
  day.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Although I like French cookery, I am not sufficiently acquainted with the interior
  of French kitchens to know whether we should improve in the fitting up of ours by imitating our
  neighbours. When I was abroad, and had opportunities of informing myself upon this subject, I had
  not the present work in contemplation. And though it is the object of travellers in general to
  inquire into almost every thing while passing through a foreign country, it happened once to me to
  meet with so much discouragement, when prying into the culinary department of a large Hotel in the
  south of France, that I hesitated to enter a foreign kitchen again. I was then on the way to
  Italy, and from what was afterwards told me respecting the kitchens of the latter country, I have
  reason to think that my resolution was not unwise, since, had it been overcome by fresh curiosity,
  I might have been induced to starve from too intimate knowledge of the mode in which the dishes of
  our table were prepared. We had, at the hotel I am speaking of, fared sumptuously for three days.
  There were, among other things, the finest poultry and the most delicate pastry imaginable. But
  some chicken broth was wanted for an invalid of our party, and the landlord suggested that if
  Mademoiselle would herself give directions to the cook, the broth might, perhaps, be the better
  made; and he went, accordingly, to announce my intended visit to the important person who
  commanded in the kitchen. Upon receiving intimation that all was ready, I descended, and was
  introduced to the said cook, who met me at the door of a large, lofty, vaulted apartment, the
  walls of which were black, not from any effect of antiquity, but from those of modern smoke, and
  decorated with a variety of copper utensils, all nearly as black on their outsides as the walls on
  which they hung. Of what hue their insides might be I did not ascertain; and, at the moment, my
  attention was suddenly diverted by the cook, who, begging me to be seated, placed a chair by the
  side of a large, wild-looking fire-place. I had not expected to see a tall, thin and bony, or a
  short and <span class="pagenum" id="page43">{43}</span>fat woman, like the cook of an English
  kitchen; I imagined a man, somewhat advanced in age, and retaining some traces of the <i>ancien
  regime</i>, with large features and a small body, with grizzly and half-powdered hair, and,
  perhaps, a pigtail; at all events, with slippers down at heel, hands unclean, and a large
  snuff-box. It was, therefore, not without surprise that I found the very contrary of this in the
  personage who, dressed in a white apron, white sleeves, and white night cap of unexceptionable
  cleanness, and bowing with a grace that would have done credit to the most accomplished <i>petit
  matre</i> of the last century, proceeded to relate how he had been instructed in the art of
  making chicken broth by an English <i>Miledi</i>, who in passing into Italy for the benefit of her
  health, had staid some weeks at the Hotel de l'Europe. His detail of the process of broth-making
  was minute, and no doubt scientific, but unhappily for the narrator, it was interrupted by his
  producing a delicate white fowl, which he without ceremony laid on the kitchen table, which stood
  in the middle of the room, and rivalled the very walls themselves in blackness. I was assured, by
  the first glance at this table, by reason of the fragments of fish, fowl, and pastry, strewed over
  it, that the same piece of furniture served every purpose of <i>chopping-block</i> and
  <i>paste-board</i>. When, therefore, under these circumstances, I saw the preparation for the
  broth just going to commence, the exclamation of "Dirty pigs!" was making its way to my lips, and
  I, in order to avoid outraging the ears of French politeness, in the spot of all France most
  famous for the romantic, made the best of my way out of the kitchen, and endeavoured, when the
  next dinner-time arrived, to forget that I had ever seen it. Whenever afterwards the figure of
  this black table appeared to my fancy, like a spectre rising to warn me against tasteful and
  delicate looking <i>entremets</i>, I strove to forget the reality; but I never recovered the
  feeling of perfect security in what I was about to eat until the sea again rolled between me and
  the kitchen of the Hotel de l'Europe, and I again actually saw the clear bright fire, the whitened
  hearth, the yellow-ochred walls, the polished tins, the clean-scrubbed tables and chairs, and the
  white dresser cloths, of the kitchen, such as I had always been used to see at my own home.</p>

  <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, and so on, from the jaw-bone to the further end of the shoulder. The
  <i>sound</i> lies on the inside, and to obtain this, you must raise up the thin part of the fish,

  the knife in at <i>c</i>, and cut, as deep as the bone will allow, to <i>d</i>, and take out
  slices on either side of the line in this direction. The fat of venison becomes cold so very
  rapidly, that it is advisable, when convenient, to have some means of giving it renewed warmth
  after the joint comes to table. For this purpose, some use water plates, which have the effect of

  <p class="sp3"><i>Edge Bone of Beef</i>, like the Round of Beef, is easily carved. But care should
  be taken, with both of these, to carve neatly; for if the meat be cut in thick slices or in pieces
  of awkward shape, the effect will be both to cause waste and to render the dish, while it lasts,
  uninviting. Cut slices, as thin as you please, from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> (<i>Fig. 4</i>). The best
  part of the fat will be found on one side of the meat, from about <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>. The most
  delicate is at <i>c</i>.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Fore Quarter of Lamb</i> is first to be cut so as to divide the <i>shoulder</i>
  from the rest of the quarter, which is called <span class="pagenum" id="page50">{50}</span>the
  <i>target</i>. For this purpose, put the fork firmly into the shoulder joint, and then cut
  underneath the blade-bone beginning at <i>a</i> (<i>Fig. 5</i>), and continue all round in the
  direction of a circular line, and pretty close to the under part of the blade-bone. Some people
  like to cut the shoulder large, while others take off no more meat with it than is barely
  necessary to remove the blade-bone. It is most convenient to place the shoulder on a separate
  dish. This is carved in the same way as the shoulder of mutton. (See <i>Fig. 7</i>.) When the
  shoulder is removed, a lemon may be squeezed over that part of the remainder of the joint where
  the knife had passed: this gives a flavour to the meat which is generally approved.&mdash;Then,
  proceed to cut completely through from <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, following the line across the bones
  as cracked by the butcher; and this will divide the ribs (<i>d</i>) from the brisket (<i>e</i>).
  Tastes vary in giving preference to the ribs or to the brisket.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Leg of Mutton</i>, either boiled or roasted, is carved as in <i>Fig. 6</i>. You
  begin, by taking slices from the most meaty part, which is done by making cuts straight across the
  joint, and quite down to the bone (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), and thus continuing on towards the thick
  end, till you come to <i>c</i>, the <i>cramp-bone</i> (or, as some call it, the <i>edge-bone</i>).
  Some <span class="pagenum" id="page51">{51}</span>mutton is superfluously fat on every part of the
  leg. The most delicate fat, however, is always that which is attached to the outside, about the
  thick end. After cutting as above directed, turn the joint over, and cut longwise the leg, as with
  a haunch of venison (see <i>Fig. 1</i>). Some people like the <i>knuckle</i>, that part which lies
  to the right of <i>b</i>, though this is always the driest and the leanest. A few nice slices may
  be taken at <i>d</i>, by cutting across that end: these are not juicy, but the grain of the meat
  is fine; and here there is also some nice fat.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Shoulder of Mutton.</i>&mdash;Cut first from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> (<i>Fig.
  7</i>) as deep as the bone will permit, and take out slices on each side of this line. Then cut in
  a line with and on both sides of the ridges of the blade-bone, which will be found running in the
  direction <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>. The meat of this part is some of the most delicate, but there is
  not much of it. You may get some nice slices between <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, though these will
  sometimes be very fat. Turn the joint over, and take slices from the flat surface of the under
  part: these are the coarsest, yet some think the best.&mdash;In small families it is sometimes the
  practice to cut the under side while hot; this leaves the joint better looking for the next
  day.</p>

  </div>

  <p><i>Ham</i> is generally cut by making a deep incision across the top of it, as from <i>a</i> to
  <i>b</i>, and down to the bone. Those who like the <i>knuckle</i> end, which is the most lean and
  dry, may cut towards <i>c</i>; but the prime part of the ham is that between <i>a</i> and the
  thick end. Some prefer carving hams with a more slanting cut, beginning in a direction as from
  <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, and so continuing throughout to the thick end. The slanting mode is,
  however, apt to be very wasteful, unless the carver be careful not to take away too much fat in
  proportion to the lean.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Sucking Pig</i> should always be cut up by the cook; at least, the principal
  parts should be divided before the dish is served. First, take off the <i>head</i> immediately
  behind the ears: then cut the body in two, by carrying the knife quite through from the neck to
  the tail. The <i>legs</i> and the <i>shoulders</i> must next be removed from the sides, and each
  of them cut in two at their respective joints. The <i>sides</i> may either be sent to table whole,
  or cut up: if the latter, separate the whole length of each side into three or four pieces. The
  <i>head</i> should be split in two, and the lower jaws divided from the upper part of it; let the
  <i>ears</i> be cut off. In serving, a neat cook will take care to arrange the different parts thus
  separated so that they may appear, upon the dish, as little uneven and confused as possible. The
  sides, whether whole or in several pieces, should be laid parallel with each other; the legs and
  <span class="pagenum" id="page53">{53}</span>shoulders on the outer side of these, and opposite to
  the parts to which they have respectively belonged; and the portions of the head, and the ears,
  may be placed, some at one end, and some at the other end, or, as taste may suggest, at the sides
  of the dish.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Hare, or Rabbit, for Roasting</i>, is prepared for the spit as in <i>Fig.
  9</i>.&mdash;To carve: begin by cutting through near to the back-bone, from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>;
  then make a corresponding cut on the other side of the back-bone; leaving the <i>back</i> and the
  <i>head</i> in one distinct piece. Cut off the <i>legs</i> at the hip joint (<i>e</i>), and take
  off the <i>wing</i> nearly as you would the wing of a bird, carrying the knife round the circular
  line (<i>c</i>). The <i>ribs</i> are of little importance, as they are bare of meat. Divide the
  <i>back</i> into three or four portions, as pointed out by the letters <i>f g h</i>. The
  <i>head</i> is then to be cut off, and the lower jaws divided from the upper. By splitting the
  upper part of the head in the middle you have the <i>brains</i>, which are prized by epicures. The
  comparative goodness of different parts of a hare, will depend much on the age, and also upon the
  cooking. The back and the legs are always the best. The wing of a young hare is nice; but this is
  not so good in an old one, and particularly if it be not thoroughly well done. The carving of a
  <i>rabbit</i> is pretty much the same as that of a hare: there is much less difficulty, however,
  with the former; and it would always save a good deal of trouble, as well as delay, if hares which
  are not quite young were sent to table already cut up.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Turkey or Fowl, for Boiling.</i>&mdash;For boiling, turkeys and fowls should,
  according to the newest fashion, both be trussed in the same way. There is nothing peculiar in
  this way, excepting as to the legs, which are to be trussed <i>within the apron</i>. To do this,
  the cook must first cut off the feet, and then, putting her fingers into the inside of the fowl,
  separate the skin of the leg from the flesh, all the way to the extreme joint. The leg, being
  drawn back, will thus remain, as it were, in a bag, within the apron; and, if this be properly
  done, there need be no other break in the skin than what has been occasioned at the joint by
  cutting the feet. If it be a turkey, or a large fowl, the form may be better preserved, by putting
  a skewer through the legs as well as through the wings (<i>see Fig. 15</i>). But with small fowls
  there needs no skewer for the legs. All skewers used in trussing should be taken out before the
  dish comes to table. To carve fowls, turkeys, &amp;c., see <i>Fig. 15</i>. Begin by taking off the
  <i>wings</i>, cutting from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>. Next the <i>legs</i>,
  putting your knife in at <i>f f</i>. Then, if it be a large bird, you will help slices from the
  breast (<i>e e</i>). But with the smaller birds, as chickens, partridges, &amp;c., a considerable
  portion of the breast should come off with the wing, and then there is not enough left to spare
  any thing more from the breast-bone. <i>The merry-thought</i>, situated at the point of the
  breast-bone, is taken off by cutting straight across at <i>h h</i>. In helping, recollect that the
  <i>liver-wing</i> is <span class="pagenum" id="page57">{57}</span>commonly thought more of than
  the other. The <i>breast-bone</i> is divided from the back by simply cutting through the ribs on
  each side of the fowl. The <i>neck-bones</i> are at <i>g g</i>; but for these see <i>Fig. 16</i>,
  and the directions for carving the <i>back</i>.</p>

  line, just opposite to <i>c d</i>; others at the rump end of the bones <i>e f</i>. The
  <i>neck-bones</i> (at <i>g h</i>) are the most difficult part of the task. These must be taken off
  before the breast is divided from the back; they adhere very closely, and require the knife to be
  held firmly on the body of the fowl, while the fork is employed to twist them off.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">There</span> is no branch of cookery which requires more nicety than plain
  boiling, though, from its simplicity, some cooks think it does not. They think that to put a piece
  of meat into water, and to make that boil for a given length of time, is all that is needful; but
  it is not so. To boil a leg of mutton, or a fowl, properly, requires as much care as to compound a
  made dish. Meat which is poor and tough cannot be made tender and fine flavoured by boiling; but
  that which was, to all appearance, very fine meat before it was put into the pot, has often been
  taken out really good for nothing. And many a Butcher and Poulterer have been blamed, when the
  fault was not theirs.</p>

  <p>Meat should be put into cold water, enough to keep it <i>well</i> covered. The longer in reason
  it is coming to a boil, the better, as a gradual heating produces tenderness, and causes a
  separation from the meat of the grosser particles, which rise in the shape of scum to the surface,
  and which should be carefully taken off. The finest leg of mutton must be disgusting, if garnished
  with flakes of black scum. Care should be taken to watch the first moment of the scum's appearing
  in order to remove it, and then, by throwing in a little salt, the remainder will be caused to
  rise; and if the fast boiling of the water render the scumming difficult, pour in a very little
  cold water. The practice of boiling meat, such as poultry, veal, and lamb, in floured cloths, to
  keep it white, must have been the invention of lazy cooks, if not of tasteless and extravagant
  housewives; for the meat is rendered less juicy, and the liquor in which it has been boiled, so
  good for broth or gravy, must be lost.</p>

  <p>When the pot has been well scummed, and no more scum to be seen, set in such a situation on, or
  by, the fire, that it may continue to boil <i>gently</i> and <i>regularly</i>, for the time
  required; and see that it do not stop boiling <span class="pagenum"
  id="page60">{60}</span>altogether at one time, and then be hurried to a wallop at another time,
  for this dries up the juices, hardens the meat, and tears it. A kettle of boiling water should be
  at hand, in order to replenish the pot, as the quantity diminishes, taking heed not to exceed the
  original quantity, namely, enough to <i>cover</i> the meat, for the less water, the better the
  broth will be.</p>

  <p>Salted meat, if very salt, and all smoked meat, should be washed, and in some cases,
  <i>soaked</i> before it is boiled. If too little salted, it must not be either washed or scraped,
  and may be put on to boil in water a little heated, because a slow process would help to freshen
  it.</p>

  <p>No positive rule can be given for the time required to boil meat, any more than to roast, for
  much depends on its freshness, and a piece of <i>solid</i> meat requires a longer time to boil
  than a joint of equal weight but of less thickness. Salted and smoked meat require longer boiling
  than fresh meat, veal longer than beef, mutton, or lamb; and pork, though ever so little salted,
  still longer than veal. A leg of mutton which has hung long will boil in less time than one which
  is quite or nearly fresh; but then the former ought not to be boiled at all, but roasted, for the
  fire takes away mustiness, and all the impurities with which the boiling water would only tend
  still more to impregnate the meat. A quarter of an hour, and a quart of water, to every pound of
  meat, is the rule of boiling, but practice must teach this, as well as many other important parts
  of culinary science. By a little care and attention, a cook will soon gain sufficient experience
  to preserve her from the risk of sending a joint to table too little, or too much done.</p>

  <p>When meat is sufficiently boiled, take it up directly; and if it have to wait, stand it over
  the pot it was cooked in, to keep it hot; remaining in the water will sodden it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The next thing for consideration, after that of cooking the meat properly, is the
  turning to account the liquor in which it is boiled. This, be the meat what it may, is good as a
  foundation for <i>Soups</i> or <i>Gravies</i> unless it be the liquor of ham or bacon, and that
  can only be used in small quantities, to flavour. The liquor of pork makes good pease soup. When
  such liquor is not wanted for the family, it may always, at a trifling expense, be converted <span
  class="pagenum" id="page61">{61}</span>into wholesome and nourishing food for the poor. (<i>See
  cookery for the poor.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Round of Beef.</i></p>

  <p>If too large a joint to dress whole, for a small family, or where cold meat is not liked, it
  may be cut into two or even three pieces, taking care to give to each piece a due portion of fat;
  skewer it up tightly, of a good shape, then bind it with strong coarse tape, or strips of linen.
  The vessel roomy, the beef placed on a fish drainer (as should all large joints), and care taken
  to keep it covered with water. Three hours for a piece of 12 lbs. About three hours and a half to
  16 lbs., and so on, in proportion. Put in carrots and turnips two hours after the meat. See that
  there be no scum left on, before you send it to table. Garnish with sliced carrots, and serve
  mashed turnips or greens, in a separate dish. Also dumplings, if approved.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The whole round, if 30 lbs. weight, will require to boil five hours. But remember,
  that the <i>boiling</i> should be only steady <i>simmering</i>. Place the vessel over the fire,
  that the water may come to a boil; then draw it to the side, and never let it cease to simmer.
  Have a kettle of boiling water by the side, to fill up with.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Edge Bone of Beef.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">One of 20 lbs. weight will require to boil three hours and a half. One of 10 lbs.

  <p class="ac"><i>Brisket of Beef.</i></p>

  <p>This being a long, awkward joint, may be cut in two; it requires longer boiling than the edge
  bone; five hours not too much for a large piece. (See <i>Beef to Press.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp3">For <i>Bouilli</i> and other ways of cooking beef, see the <i>Index</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Leg of Mutton.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This joint should be kept from two days to a week. Cut out the pipe, and carefully
  wipe the meat to clear it of all <span class="pagenum" id="page62">{62}</span>mustiness. Chop but
  a very small piece off the shank. Boil carrots and turnips with it if you <i>like</i>, but the
  former will not improve the colour; and do not put them in before the pot has been carefully
  scummed. A leg of 9 lbs. will take three hours <i>slow</i> boiling. Garnish with slices of carrot,
  or a rim of mashed turnip. Serve caper sauce in a boat. <i>Walnut</i> also is good, in place of
  capers. If chickens or a fowl be wanted for the same dinner, they may boil in the same vessel with
  the mutton, but not with vegetables. The <i>broth</i> will be better for this addition. If broth
  be wanted the same day, put into the water, as soon as it has been scummed, some barley or rice,
  and after it has boiled one hour and a half, lift out the mutton and place it by the fire, covered
  to keep warm; take the lid off the pot, and let it boil quickly till the liquor be reduced to the
  quantity you desire; put in turnips and carrots, in small pieces, a head of celery, and a little
  parsley; return the mutton, and boil it slowly half an hour.&mdash;A leg of mutton, if too large
  to cook at once, may be divided into two; roast the fillet and boil the shank. <i>Or</i>: you may
  take cutlets off the large end two days running, and then dress the shank.&mdash;Tongue is good
  with boiled mutton.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Neck of Mutton.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Should be very much trimmed of its fat, and, if from 3 to 5 lbs. weight, boil
  <i>slowly</i> two hours; it will likewise make very good broth, as the leg. Garnish and serve in
  the same way.&mdash;Some do not cut off any of the fat, until after it is cooked, then pare it
  off, and put it by: this, shred finely, makes light pudding crust.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Leg of Lamb.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">A delicate dish, if nicely boiled, served with parsley and butter, and garnished
  with sprigs of cauliflower, brocoli, or spinach. A dish of the latter should be served with it.
  (<i>See in the Index.</i>) If small, the loin may be cut into steaks, fried, and placed round the
  leg, lightly garnished with crisped parsley; or they may be placed round mashed potatoes, in
  another dish. A leg of 5 lbs. should <i>simmer</i> gently two hours, counting from the time it is
  first put on, in cold water.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page63">{63}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Calf's Head.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash it well in several waters, and soak it in warm water for a quarter of an hour,
  but first take the brains out, and having well washed, let them soak in cold water with a little
  salt for an hour. <i>Half</i> the head (without the skin), will require <i>gentle</i> boiling two
  hours; with the skin, another hour. Put it on in cold water. Boil 8 or 10 sage leaves, and the
  same quantity in bulk of parsley, half an hour, then drain, chop very fine, and spread them on a
  plate. Scald and peel the skin off the brains, put them into a saucepan with plenty of cold water:
  when it boils, carefully scum it, and let it boil gently fifteen minutes; chop the brains, but not
  very fine, and put them into a small saucepan with the parsley and sage, also 2 table-spoonsful of
  thin melted butter, a little salt, and, if you like, cayenne and lemon juice. Take the tongue out
  of the head, trim off the roots, skin and place it in the middle of a dish, the brains round it.
  Pour parsley and butter over the head, garnish with broiled rashers of bacon. Serve ham, bacon, or
  pork, and greens. Save a quart of the liquor to make sauce for the hash (<i>which see</i>). A very
  good sauce for this, eaten in France, is as follows: 2 table-spoonsful of chopped eschalots, 1 of
  parsley, 1 of tarragon and chervil, 1 of salt, a little pepper, 6 table-spoonsful of salad oil, 1
  of vinegar: mix well together and serve cold.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">In some parts of England a boiled fillet is considered a delicacy. It should not be
  large. Stuff it the same as for roasting (<i>which see</i>), or with the forcemeat directed for
  boiled turkey. Serve white sauce, and garnish with slices of lemon and barberries.&mdash;The neck
  is good boiled, and eaten with parsley and butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pork.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This must be exceedingly well done. Wash and scrape a leg, and let it lie in cold
  water a quarter of an hour to whiten; put it on to boil in cold water; do not let it boil fast,
  because the knuckle will be broken to pieces, before the thick part of the meat is done. Be
  careful to <span class="pagenum" id="page64">{64}</span>take off all the scum, and let a leg of 7
  lbs. weight simmer three hours. If to eat cold, do not cut it in the middle, because that will
  allow too much gravy to be lost, but cut from the knuckle, and it will eat more tender. Peas
  pudding with leg of pork, also parsnips, carrots, turnips or greens, and mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Petit-Toes.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put a thin slice of bacon at the bottom of a stew-pan, with a little broth or thin
  melted butter, a blade of mace, a few peppercorns, and a sprig of thyme; in this boil the feet,
  the heart, liver and lights, till tender; the three latter will be done first; take them out and
  mince them fine: put this mince and the feet into another saucepan with some good gravy thickened
  with butter rolled in flour, season with pepper, salt, and a small quantity of walnut and mushroom
  catsup; let it simmer five minutes. While this is cooking prepare some sippets of toasted bread,
  lay them round a dish, pour the mince and sauce into the middle, and having split the feet, lay
  them lightly on the top.&mdash;A little cream may be added. (<i>See to fry.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Poultry.</i></p>

  <p>Be careful in picking, that the skin be not broken. Some cooks wash poultry, but if wiping will
  be sufficient, it is best not washed. Chickens and fowls will keep two or three days, except in
  very hot weather. A fowl put on in cold water, should simmer by the side of the fire, from
  twenty-five minutes to half an hour. Some cooks boil a little fresh suet sliced, and also slices
  of lemon peel, with fowl. Some boil them in milk and water. The water must be well scummed.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Boiled Fowls</i> with white sauce, or mushroom, oyster, celery, liver, or lemon
  sauce, or parsley and butter. A pretty remove of fish or soup, is, a small tongue in the centre, a
  boiled chicken on each side, and small heads of brocoli, with a few asparagus and French beans to
  fill the spaces. Serve any of the above sauces.&mdash;Always ham, bacon or tongue, and some sort
  of green vegetable, with fowl and turkey; chine with the latter. Garnish with slices of lemon.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page65">{65}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ducks.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose fine fat ones. Some persons salt them slightly, for two days, others boil
  them without. Smother them with onions, or serve onion sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Turkey.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Let it hang four days, and take care not to blacken it in singeing. It is usual to
  fill the crop of a turkey with forcemeat (<i>see forcemeats</i>), or with a stuffing of
  bread-crumbs, suet shred fine, a little parsley, thyme, and lemon peel, chopped fine, nutmeg,
  pepper, and salt, the whole mixed together by an egg. In America it is the practice to stuff
  turkeys with oysters chopped and mixed with bread-crumbs. About 4 would be sufficient. A large
  turkey, with the crop filled, requires two hours <i>slow</i> boiling; not filled, half an hour
  less; and a small hen turkey an hour. Serve with oyster or celery sauce, and either chine, bacon
  or tongue. The forcemeat may be enriched by grated tongue or ham, chopped veal, an anchovy and a
  little bit of eschalot. (<i>See to hash, also grill.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rabbits.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">A full-sized one will boil in half an hour; an old one above an hour. Some use
  <i>milk</i> and water. Serve with onion sauce poured over; or a sauce made of melted butter, and
  the livers, previously boiled, and minced small, with a little parsley. Lay slices of lemon round
  the dish. Ham or Bacon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Bacon</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Should be well washed and scraped, and old bacon soaked in cold water. After coming
  slowly to a boil, let a piece of 4 lbs. simmer by the fire two hours, if young and fresh cured,
  less time. Some cooks put fat bacon into hot water, and lean into cold. Take off the rind and set
  it before the fire to dry up the oozing fat. Strew bread-raspings over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ham.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The main thing to be attended to is the previous soaking, and the requisite time
  must be left to the discretion of the cook, for, whereas one night would be sufficient for a small
  <span class="pagenum" id="page66">{66}</span>and tender ham, if very old and dry, less than four
  days and four nights will scarcely be enough. The water should be changed every day, and the night
  before it is boiled, scrape well, pour warm water over it, and trim off all the rusty,
  ill-looking, bits, then lay it in the water again. Scum the pot, and let the ham <i>simmer from
  three to five</i> hours, according to its weight. When done, take the skin off gently, and after
  covering the ham with bread-raspings, set it before the fire, to crisp it. Twist writing paper
  round the shank, and garnish with greens, or little heaps of bread-raspings. The liquor, if well
  scummed at first, may be strained or put by, and if you boil fowls or veal on the following day,
  you may put the two liquors together, boil them rapidly down; add pepper, mace, eschalot, and a
  faggot of herbs, and you will have a highly relishing gravy. Some persons contend that the
  practice of boiling a ham until half cooked, and then finishing by <i>baking</i> it, improves the
  flavour. (<i>See to bake meat.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tongue.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If you buy it salted, learn how long it has been in pickle, for according to that
  it must soak. If old and hard, twenty-four hours will not be too much. Have plenty of water, and
  let it be a full hour in coming to a boil; then <i>simmer gently</i> for three hours; longer if
  very large. The root is an excellent ingredient for peas soup.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tripe.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut in cutlets, or not, as you choose, and simmer it in milk and water till quite
  tender. Peel and boil a dozen button onions, put the tripe in a deep dish with some of the sauce,
  and the onions on the top; or you may boil it in plain water. Mustard sauce is good.&mdash;As all
  persons would not choose onions, you may serve onion sauce as directed for rabbits (<i>which
  see</i>). Serve rashers of bacon, if approved.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cow-Heel.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">When well boiled, cut into nice pieces, egg, bread crumb, and fry them of a light
  brown, and serve with fried onions or any piquant sauce. Is very good only boiled, and served with
  parsley and butter.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="VIII. Roasting" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER VIII.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">ROASTING.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">For</span> roasting, meat should be kept longer than for boiling, or it will
  not, though ever so good, eat well. The proper length of time depends upon the state of the
  weather, and the age of the animal when killed, for young meat bears keeping less time than old
  meat. Two days of hot weather will do as much to render meat fit for the spit, as a week of cold
  weather.</p>

  <p>Next after the state of the meat, the thing of most consequence is preparing the fire, which
  ought to be made up (of the size required by the length and breadth of the joint) half an hour
  before the meat is put down. It should not at first be exposed to a fierce fire. Let there be a
  backing of wetted cinders or small coals: this tends to throw the heat in front; lay large coals
  on the top, smaller ones between the bars, give the fire time to draw, and it will be clear.
  Before you put down the meat, stir the fire, clear it at the bottom, and see that it be free from
  smoke in front.</p>

  <p>Some cooks make a practice of washing meat, with salt and water, then wiping it dry, before it
  is roasted. Where there is mustiness, or slimy appearance, it should be wiped off with a wet
  cloth, otherwise much washing is neither necessary nor beneficial. See that it be properly
  jointed; if there be too much fat, cut it off (it is better for puddings, in the shape of suet,
  than dripping); cover the meat with kitchen paper, <i>tied</i> on with twine, and not fastened by
  <i>pins</i>; see also, that the spit be bright and clean, and take care to run it through the
  meat, in the right place, at once, for the more the meat is perforated, the greater chance will be
  given for the escape of the gravy. Great nicety is required in spitting, that the joint may be
  accurately balanced. In the absence of spits and smoke-jacks, a bottle-jack, or a stout nail with
  a strong string or skein of worsted, will <span class="pagenum" id="page68">{68}</span>dangle a
  joint, and if the fire be made proportionably high to the length of the joint, there is no better
  mode of roasting. A strong skewer must be run in, at each end of the joint, in order to turn
  it.</p>

  <p>The larger the joint the greater distance it should, at first, be from the fire, that the
  outside may not be shrivelled up before the middle is warmed. A quarter of an hour to a pound of
  meat, is the rule for roasting, and it admits of the same exceptions as in the case of boiling,
  with this addition, that fat meat takes longer than lean meat, as do pork and veal longer than any
  other kind. Fillets and legs, on account of their solidness, longer than loins and breasts. Much
  depends upon the situation of the fire-place, and whether the joint be exposed to draughts of cold
  air, or whether it be preserved from them, and the fire assisted, by a meat screen. Where there is
  none, a contrivance must be resorted to, by way of substitute, such as small wooden horses, or
  chairs, with cloths hung over them; these will keep off the cold, but a meat screen, lined with
  tin, keeps in the heat, and acts as a reflector.&mdash;Twice, or if the roast be large, oftener,
  remove the pan, pour off the dripping (it ought to be strained), draw the spit to a distance, and
  stir the fire, bring forward the hot coals, and put fresh at the back. Be careful that cinders do
  not reach the dripping-pan, for the smoke which they cause to rise from the fat, gives a
  disagreeable flavour to the meat, besides the injury to the dripping. (<i>See
  Dripping.</i>)&mdash;When the meat is nearly done, the steams will draw towards the fire; take the
  paper off, and move the joint nearer to the fire, particularly the ends, if they want more
  cooking; sprinkle salt lightly over the roast; then pour off all the remaining dripping, dredge
  flour <i>very lightly</i> over the joint, and baste with a very little fresh butter, which will
  not injure the gravy in the pan, but give a delicate froth to the meat. To the gravy now flowing
  from the meat, the best addition is a teacupful of boiling water. (<i>See Gravies.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp3">With a clear strong fire (and meat cannot be well roasted without a strong fire),
  time allowed for gradual cooking, a cook may ensure for her roasts that fine pale brown colour, to
  produce which is esteemed one of the greatest proofs of a cook's skill.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page69">{69}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sirloin of Beef.</i></p>

  <p>After reading the foregoing observations, the cook must gain, by observation and practice, that
  experience which will enable her to send this very best of joints to table, done enough, yet not
  overdone. A piece of 15 lbs. weight will require nearly four hours to cook it well: cover it with
  two half sheets of foolscap paper, and put it near to the fire for a few minutes; then rub it well
  over with butter, and draw it back to a distance (provided always that there is a very <i>good,
  steady</i> fire); and in this case do not baste at all, but put some boiling water into the
  dripping-pan when you first put the meat down, and this, by the time the meat is done, will be
  good gravy, after you have poured the fat off. The older fashion is to baste with dripping as soon
  as you put it down, and continue the basting every quarter of an hour; but I think the other
  method gives the meat the most delicate taste and appearance. However, a cook should try both
  ways, and afterwards follow the one which best suits the taste of her employers.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The old fashion of Yorkshire pudding with roast beef is too good a one to be
  abandoned, though its substitute of potatoe pudding is not to be rejected. Garnish with finely
  scraped horseradish.&mdash;Where cold roast beef is not liked, or if too underdone to eat cold,
  slices may be gently simmered over the fire in gravy or broth, or a very little water, and a
  little pepper and salt, eschalot vinegar, or some sort of catsup. The sirloin always came to table
  whole in the house in which I was brought up; therefore, I am able to give instructions for
  cooking it. No spit will carry round a whole sirloin; it must be <i>dangled</i>, and one which
  weighs (after great part of the suet has been taken out) 40 lbs. will roast in five hours, for it
  is no thicker than a piece of 10 lbs. weight. The fire must be large and high, the heat, of
  course, very great. Many a cook's complexion, to say nothing of her temper, has suffered in the
  cause of our "noble sirloins." If the inside, or tender-loin, be taken out leaving all the fat to
  roast with the joint, this part may be cooked to resemble hare. For this purpose, spread some hare
  stuffing over the beef, roll that up tightly with tape, and tie it on the spit. Send this to table
  with the sauces for roast hare. When the whole joint is roasted, the inside <span class="pagenum"
  id="page70">{70}</span>will be sufficiently underdone to make hashes. If only a part of the
  sirloin be cooked, the inside is best eaten hot, as it is not so good cold as the upper
  side.&mdash;Roast beef bones should be taken care of, for soup and gravy, and used before they
  become musty.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rump of Beef.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Roast in the same manner. <i>Half</i> of this joint makes a nice family dish.
  Parboiled potatoes, browned in the dripping-pan are good.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ribs of Beef.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Roasted the same as the sirloin. But it requires to be basted. Is a better joint to
  eat cold than sirloin. 15 or 20 lbs. weight, three hours or more, according to the size. Paper the
  fat and the thin part. Another way is to take out the bones, lay the meat flat, and beat it with a
  rolling pin; soak it in two thirds of vinegar and one of water, or, better still, white wine in
  place of vinegar, a night; next day cover it with a rich forcemeat, of veal, suet, grated ham,
  lemon peel, and mixed spices. Roll it tightly up, fasten with small skewers and tape, and roast
  it, basting constantly with butter, and serve with venison sauce.&mdash;<i>Or:</i> you may take
  out the bones, roll the meat up like a fillet of veal, lard it, then roast and serve with tomata
  sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Leg, Loin, Haunch, Saddle, and Shoulder of Mutton.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut out the pipe that runs along the back bone, wipe off all mustiness. Rather a
  <i>quick</i> fire is required for mutton, particularly if it have been kept. Roast in the same
  manner as beef. Paper it, and baste every twenty minutes till the last half hour, when lightly
  sprinkle with salt, baste with <i>butter</i>, and dredge flour lightly over, and as soon as the
  froth rises, take it up. Onion, sweet sauce, or currant jelly, are eaten with mutton. Some think
  it an improvement to the <i>haunch</i> and <i>saddle</i> to take the skin off; to do this you must
  beat it well with a rolling pin, slip the skin with a sharp knife from the meat, and with a cloth
  pull it off nearly to the shank. Some put a thin paste over, as directed for venison, others paper
  only, and the latter is sufficient, if the cook baste enough, and do not let <span class="pagenum"
  id="page71">{71}</span>it burn.&mdash;A good sauce for roast mutton is made by putting 2 glasses
  of port wine, 1 of Reading sauce, and a tea-spoonful of garlic vinegar into a small saucepan, and
  pouring the contents hot over the joint just before serving it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Haunch of Mutton.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>To dress as Venison.</i>&mdash;Keep it as long as you can, then rub with the
  following, and let it lie in it, thirty-six hours. Mix 2 oz. of coarse sugar, 1 oz. of salt, and 
  oz. of saltpetre. A taste somewhat peculiar to our house, and of American growth, is stewed
  cranberries, as sauce with roast mutton, and I recommend the trial to all who can procure good
  cranberries. Tomata sauce is also good with roast mutton.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Bullock's Heart.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak it well in lukewarm water to disgorge, dry and stuff the interior with a veal
  stuffing, and roast it two hours. <i>Calves'</i> and <i>Sheep's</i> heart the same.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tongue.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stick a fresh tongue all over with cloves, roast it, baste with butter, and serve
  with port wine sauce, and currant jelly.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sucking Pig.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The age at which it ought to be killed is a matter of dispute; some say at twelve
  days old, others at three weeks; but all agree that the sooner it is cooked after, the better.
  After the inside is taken out, wash the pig well with cold water. Cut off the feet at the first
  joint, leaving the skin long enough to turn neatly over. Prepare a stuffing as follows:  oz. of
  mild sage, 2 onions, parboiled and chopped fine, a tea-cup full of grated bread crumbs, 2 oz. of
  good butter, and some pepper, cayenne and salt; put this into the pig, and carefully sew the slit
  up. Some cooks baste, at first, with salt and water, and then keep brushing the pig with a brush
  of feathers, dipped in salad oil. Others tie a piece of butter in muslin, and diligently rub the
  crackling with it; either is good. It should be dredged with flour, soon after it is put down, and
  the <span class="pagenum" id="page72">{72}</span>rubbing with butter or oil never cease, or the
  skin will not be crisp. The fire should be brisk, and a pig iron used, or the pig will be
  unequally cooked, for the middle will be burnt up, before the two ends are done. A good-sized one
  will take two hours. A pig should never go whole to table. Take the spit from the fire, and place
  it across a dish, then with a sharp knife cut the head off, cut down the back, and slip the spit
  out. Lay it back to back in your dish, and the ears, one at each end, which ought to be quite
  crisp. For sauce, clear beef, or veal gravy, with a squeeze of lemon, and, if approved, the brains
  and liver, or a little of the stuffing out of the pig, mixed in it, also a very little finely
  chopped sage. Apple sauce and currant sauce are not yet out of fashion for roast pig. Chili or
  eschalot vinegar is an improvement to pig-sauce. The easiest way is to <i>bake it</i>. (See
  <i>Baking.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Venison, Haunch or Shoulder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This will hang three weeks with care, but must be watched. Wet it as little as
  possible; a damp cloth, only, should be used to cleanse it. Butter a sheet of kitchen paper, and
  tie it over the fat side of the joint, then lay over that a paste of about  an inch thick of
  flour and water; tie another sheet of paper over that, fasten all on firmly, and rub butter over
  the outside paper, that the fire may not catch it. Baste well, and keep up a strong clear fire. A
  haunch of from 20 to 25 lbs. weight, in a paste, will take from four to five hours, and not be
  overdone. Half an hour before it is ready take off the coverings, and put it nearer the fire to
  brown and froth. Baste with fresh butter, and lightly dredge it with flour. For sauce, currant
  jelly in heated port wine, in one boat, and clear drawn, unspiced gravy, in another. (<i>See
  Gravies.</i>) Raspberry vinegar may be used in making sauce for venison. Some epicures like
  eschalots or small onions, served with venison, hare, or any meat, eaten with sweet
  sauce.&mdash;The shoulder, breast, and neck, are all roasted, but the two latter are best in pies;
  and if lean, may be used in soup.&mdash;Serve French beans, and currant jelly.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fawn.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This should, like a sucking-pig, be dressed soon after it <span class="pagenum"
  id="page73">{73}</span>is killed. When quite young, it is trussed and stuffed like hare. But it is
  best, when large enough, cut in quarters, and dressed like lamb. The hind quarter is the best. It
  may be half roasted, and then hashed like hare or venison.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: in pies the same as
  venison. It may also be baked. Venison sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Must have a strong and brisk fire. It must not only be <i>well done through</i>,
  but be of a nice brown. For the fillet a stuffing of forcemeat made thus: two parts of stale
  bread-crumbs, one part suet, marrow or fresh butter, a little parsley boiled for a minute and
  chopped fine, 2 tea-spoonsful of grated lemon peel, a little nutmeg, a very little cayenne and
  some salt, the whole to be worked to a proper consistence, with yolks of 2 or 3 eggs. Many things
  may be used in flavouring stuffing, such as grated ham, beef, sausages, pickled oysters, anchovy,
  sweet herbs, eschalots, mushrooms, truffles, morels, currie powder and cayenne. The fillet should
  be covered with paper, and securely fastened in a nice shape. Baste well, and half an hour before
  you take it up, remove the paper, and bring the meat nearer the fire, to brown it. Garnish with
  slices of lemon. When in the dish, pour some thin melted butter over it, to mix with its own
  gravy. A fillet of 15 lbs. weight will require 4 hours' roasting. Serve sausages, ham, or bacon,
  and greens.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Shoulder of Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stuff it, using more suet or butter than for the fillet. Serve and garnish the
  same. From three hours to three and a half.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Loin of Veal</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Must be well jointed. The kidney fat papered, or it will be lost. Toast half the
  round of a loaf, and place it in the dish under the kidney part, and serve and garnish the same as
  the fillet. About three hours.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Breast of Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Keep it covered with the caul till nearly done, for that will preserve the meat
  from being scorched, and will also <span class="pagenum" id="page74">{74}</span>enrich
  it.&mdash;From one hour and a half to two hours. Some put in a very delicate stuffing.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Neck, best end.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Two hours to roast.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Leg of Pork.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make a slit in the shank, and put in a stuffing of mild sage, and parboiled onions,
  chopped fine, also pepper, salt, grated stale bread-crumbs, a piece of butter, a tea-spoonful of
  made mustard, and an egg to cement the whole, then sew it up. Rub the skin often all over with
  salad oil or fresh butter, while the roast is going on. The skin must be scored about twenty
  minutes after the pork is put down. A leg of 8 lbs. about three hours. Serve onion sauce, mustard,
  or apple sauce. (<i>See Sauces.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Spare Rib.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">When put to the fire, dust some flour over, and baste gently with some butter. Have
  some sage leaves dried and rubbed through a hair sieve, and about a quarter of an hour <span
  class="pagenum" id="page75">{75}</span>before the meat is done, sprinkle this over it, just after
  the last basting with butter. Apple sauce; mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Loin and Griskin.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Score the loin, and, if you like, stuff it as the leg, or mix powdered sage and
  finely-chopped onion with the basting. A loin of 5 lbs. two hours; if very fat, half an hour
  longer. A griskin of 7 or 8 lbs. one hour and a half. Either of these may be baked. Score the
  rind, rub over it well with butter or oil, and stand it in a common earthen dish, with potatoes
  peeled and cut in quarters; and, if you like, add some apples also, and two or three onions
  previously parboiled and cut up. Dress the pork round with these when you serve it. <i>Apples
  roasted</i>, and sent to table in their skins, are very good with pork.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Turkey.</i></p>

  <p>It is not a good practice to wash poultry, only to wipe it out quite clean; but if it be
  <i>necessary</i> to wash it, then dredge flour over before you put it down to the fire.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A turkey ought to hang as long as the weather will allow. Take care, in drawing,
  not to break the gall bag, for no washing would cure the mischief. It is still the custom, in some
  counties, to send a roast turkey to table with its head on. Press down the breast-bone. Fill the
  craw with a stuffing as follows: a large cup of bread-crumbs, 2 oz. minced beef suet, a little
  parsley (always parboiled, as well as onions, for stuffings), a little grated lemon peel, two or
  three sprigs of thyme, some nutmeg, pepper and salt; mix the whole well, and cement it with an
  egg. Add, if you choose, parboiled oysters (a few), or a little grated ham. Do not stuff too full,
  and keep back some of the stuffing to make little balls, to fry and garnish with, unless you have
  sausages. Paper the breast. Score the gizzard, dip it in melted butter, and then in bread-crumbs,
  fix it under the pinion, cover it with buttered paper, and be sure that it has its share of
  basting, as well as the liver, which must be placed under the other pinion. The fire must be the
  same as for beef. Keep the turkey at a distance from the fire, at first, that the breast and legs
  may be done. A very large one will require three hours, and is never so good as a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page76">{76}</span>moderate sized one, such as will roast in little more than
  one hour and a half. Dredge with flour, and baste with fresh butter, or wash it with salt butter.
  Half an hour before it is done, take off the paper, to let the turkey brown, and when the steam
  draws towards the fire, lightly dredge it with flour; then put a good sized piece of butter in the
  basting ladle, hold it over the turkey, and let it drop over it as it melts. This will give a
  finer froth than basting from the dripping-pan. Clear gravy in the dish, and more in a tureen,
  with egg, bread, or oyster sauce, in another. Chine and greens.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Capons and common Fowls.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Roasted the same as turkeys, and stuffed, if the size will admit. A large,
  full-grown fowl will take about one hour and a quarter; a chicken from thirty to forty minutes.
  The sauces for fowls are, gravy, parsley, and butter, either with or without the liver (roasted)
  chopped up in it, or mushroom, bread or egg sauce. Three or four slices of fat bacon, not too
  thick, may be attached by skewers to the breast of a fowl, and is an improvement to a large
  one.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Goose.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Well wash and dry it in a cloth; then stuff it with four onions, parboiled, a
  fourth of their bulk in sage, and half, or, if you like it, the whole of the liver; parboil these
  together slightly, and mix them with the crumb of a penny loaf and an egg. <i>Or</i>, prepare a
  stuffing of six good onions, two or three apples, and some sage; chop these together quite fine,
  season with pepper and salt, and warm it in a saucepan sufficient to half cook it. Put the
  stuffing in the goose, tie that tightly at both ends, when on the spit: keep it papered the first
  hour, and baste with a little dripping. Froth it the same as turkey. The fire must be kept brisk.
  A large goose will require two hours. Take it up before the breast falls. Its own gravy is not
  good. Serve a good gravy flavoured with port wine, or cider, and walnut catsup, also a
  table-spoonful of made mustard.&mdash;It is a good plan for the cook to cut up the goose, remove
  the joints separately on another <i>hot</i> dish, then pour the gravy boiling hot over. This may
  not be fashionable, but it preserves the <span class="pagenum" id="page77">{77}</span>goose from
  eating <i>greasy</i>, saves the lady of the house trouble, and insures its being hot when helped.
  Serve apple sauce.&mdash;Some persons like goose stuffed with potatoes, previously boiled, then
  mashed without butter, and well peppered and salted.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Geese</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Will roast in half an hour; are not stuffed. Put a good sized piece of butter
  inside, pepper and salt. Froth and brown nicely. Gooseberry sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ducks</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Will keep three days, but are better dressed the day they are killed. Ducks may be
  stuffed or not (the same as geese), according to taste. But if two are roasted, one may be
  stuffed, and the other merely seasoned inside, with pepper, salt, an eschalot, and cayenne, if
  liked. Serve green peas with ducks. From three quarters to an hour will roast them. Baste well,
  and give a good froth. (<i>See Sauces and Forcemeats.</i>) Some persons squeeze a lemon over the
  breasts when dished.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Wild Ducks</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take from twenty-five minutes to half an hour. Have a clear brisk fire. They are,
  generally, preferred underdone, but brown outside. Cut slices in the breast, and squeeze in lemon
  juice with cayenne; <i>or</i> put an oz. of butter into a stew-pan with a little cayenne, the rind
  of an orange cut thin and previously blanched in boiling water, and the juice of a lemon; warm
  this over the fire, and when melted, but not oiled, pour it over the duck and serve. (<i>See
  Sauces.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pheasants, Partridges, Guinea and Pea-fowl</i>,</p>

  <p>Require a brisk fire. All are trussed in the same way, and the heads left on. Make a slit in
  the back of the neck to take out the craw; do not turn the head under the wing, but truss it like
  a fowl, and fasten the neck to its side with a skewer. Thirty minutes will roast a young pheasant,
  and forty or fifty minutes a full grown one. Good sized partridges take nearly as long. Baste with
  butter, and <span class="pagenum" id="page78">{78}</span>froth them. Clear, well-flavoured gravy,
  in which there should be a tea-spoonful of the essence of ham. Also bread sauce.</p>

  <p class="sp3">French cooks lard all these. (<i>See to Lard.</i>) They also have a method of
  dressing them thus: lay slices of lemon over the breast, and upon these, slices of fat bacon,
  cover with paper, and roast them. Another way is to fill the bird with a delicate stuffing of
  veal, grated ham, lemon grated, and spice; then roast it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Woodcocks, Snipes, and Ortolans</i>,</p>

  <p class="sp3">Should be kept as long as they are good. Do not draw woodcocks, for the trail is
  considered a delicacy, nor cut off their heads. They should be tied to a bird spit, or dangled
  singly. The fire must be clear. Twenty or thirty minutes is enough for woodcocks, and less for the
  rest, in proportion to their size. Lay some slices of toasted bread, the crust cut off, in the
  dripping-pan, to dish them on. Serve melted butter. Garnish with slices of lemon.&mdash;In France
  they stuff woodcocks with truffles, and other things, then roast, or stew them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Grouse, Black Game, Plovers, Rails, Quails, Widgeons and Teal</i>,</p>

  <p class="sp3">Are roasted the same as partridges, the head of grouse twisted under the wing. Do
  not let them be over-done. A rich gravy, and bread sauce. Garnish with fried bread-crumbs.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pigeons.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Clean them as soon as killed, and the sooner they are dressed the better. Wash them
  very well, stuff each with a piece of butter the size of an egg, a few bread-crumbs, a little
  parsley, and the liver chopped, if you like: season well with pepper and salt. Roast twenty-five
  or thirty minutes. Pour into the dish a little thin melted butter, with or without the parsley, to
  mix with their own gravy. Serve bread or rice sauce, or parsley and butter. They may be served on
  a thin toast. Wood-pigeons should hang till tender, then roasted and served in rich gravy. They
  require less roasting than tame pigeons.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page79">{79}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Larks, Wheat-ears, and other Small Birds.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Some of these are nice eating, particularly the <i>Wheat-ear</i>, which, from its
  superior flavour, has been called the English ortolan. A roast of small birds is so much the
  fashion in France, that you seldom travel many days together without finding it one of the
  principal dishes of the supper table. In the autumn, and, indeed, through the winter, you will
  constantly see a partridge, or a woodcock, served up in the midst of a numerous company of
  blackbirds, thrushes, larks, and a variety of such small birds; a truly "dainty dish to set before
  a king." This custom is remarkable because there is a comparative scarcity of small birds in
  France, whilst we in England are overstocked with them. The <i>sparrow-pudding</i> is <i>known</i>
  in many country places, but is not often seen. Indeed, in this land of beef and mutton, it would
  be hard if these little creatures could not be left to sing and build their nests in peace. With
  the French there is such an avidity for all sorts of small birds, that a string of them is one of
  the most ordinary articles in the larder. Nothing that flies in France above the order of
  humming-birds in its size, is too insignificant to come within the scope of the sportsman's
  ambition, and the purveyor's nets and springes. I am not sure whether our exquisite neighbours
  ever proceed so far as to devour sweet Philomel herself; but they certainly do what would be
  deemed still more shocking in England, making no exception in favour of that little bird, to
  injure which is here a sort of crime; they kill the robins and cook them by dozens at a time. The
  Forest of Ardennes abounds in them, and in the season the traveller may fare sumptuously upon
  these pretty little creatures, without being aware of what he is eating. Lovers of delicacies
  might find it worth their while to travel in the countries where the vine and the fig-tree abound.
  There the small birds feed and fatten on the grapes, even in the winter, for, long after the
  conclusion of the vintage, refuse grapes may always be found hanging. This food, so superior to
  our blackberries, hips and haws, may well cause the flavour of the birds to be in the highest
  perfection: for the fruit is so nutritious that the labouring people almost entirely live upon it
  through one whole season of the year. In Sicily the grapes will keep for months <span
  class="pagenum" id="page80">{80}</span>after they are quite ripe, hanging on the vines in the open
  air. There is a little bird, about the size of the nightingale, called the <i>fig-pecker</i>, from
  its feeding upon the figs. This is one of the most prized delicacies of the south of France and
  Italy.&mdash;All the above-named birds require to be well cleaned. Then put them on a bird-spit or
  skewer, and tie that on another spit, or dangle it before the fire. Baste constantly with good
  butter, and strew sifted bread-crumbs over as they roast. French cooks generally put a thin small
  slice of bacon over the breast of each bird, bringing it over each wing. Fifteen minutes will
  roast them. Serve larks on bread-crumbs, and garnish with slices of lemon.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: dip
  the birds into a batter, then roll them in bread-crumbs.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hare</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Should, unless a leveret, hang several days, to become tender. Cooks differ as to
  the proper method of keeping it. Some keep it unpaunched, while others see that it is paunched
  instantly, wiped clean and dry inside, and then let it hang as many as eight days. If really an
  <i>old</i> hare, it should be made into soup at once, for it will never be tender enough to roast.
  The heart and liver should be taken out as soon as possible, washed, scraped, parboiled, and kept
  for the stuffing. Most cooks maintain the practice of soaking hares for two hours in water, but
  more are rendered dry and tasteless by this method than would be so naturally. A slit should be
  cut in the neck, to let the blood out, and the hare be washed in several different waters. Prepare
  a rich and relishing stuffing, as follows: the grated crumb of a penny loaf, a  lb. beef suet, or
  3 oz. of marrow, a small quantity of parsley and eschalot, a tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel,
  the same of nutmeg, salt, pepper, and the liver chopped, mix all together with the yolk of an egg;
  and an anchovy, if approved; put it inside the hare, and sew it up. For basting, most cooks use
  milk and water till within twenty minutes, or thereabouts, of the hare being done, and then baste
  with butter. But a cook of ours, first basted it with milk and water, for about ten minutes, to
  draw away the blood, then with ale, and for the last half hour with fresh dripping, until about
  five minutes before the hare was taken up, when she basted with butter to give <span
  class="pagenum" id="page81">{81}</span>a froth, having previously lightly floured it. Where cream
  and eggs abound, you may, after the hare has been basted with butter, empty the dripping pan, and
  baste with warm cream, and the yolk of an egg mixed in it. A good-sized hare will take one hour
  and a quarter to roast. Serve good gravy in a tureen, and currant jelly, or some piquant sauce.
  (<i>See Sauces.</i>) Kid is dressed the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rabbit</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">Is roasted in the same manner as hare; in addition to the stuffing, put three or
  four slices, cut very thin, of bacon. Liver sauce.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">BAKING.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Some</span> joints of meat bake to advantage. It is convenient,
  occasionally, to send the dinner out to be cooked, and the meat which suffers least from such
  cookery ought to be selected; veal is good baked, so is pork, a sucking pig, a goose, and a duck;
  but not mutton. Some pieces of beef bake well, with peeled potatoes under to catch the gravy, and
  brown. Some sorts of fish also bake well. (<i>See Fish in the Index.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Breast, Loin, Fillet, or Shoulder of Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The two last stuffed with forcemeat; put the joint on a stand in a deep baking
  dish, and stick bits of butter over the top. The heat of the oven strong, but not fierce. Baste
  often; when nearly done, sprinkle salt over, and ten minutes before it is taken out, dredge with
  flour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pig.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put it in a shallow baking dish, wrap the ears and tail in buttered paper; send a
  good sized piece of butter tied in muslin, for the baker to rub over it frequently.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Goose and Duck.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Prepare as for roasting: put them on a stand, and turn <span class="pagenum"
  id="page82">{82}</span>them when half done.&mdash;<i>Wild Goose</i> the same, with a piece of suet
  inside.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ham.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil it till half done, then cover it with a paste of flour and water, and set it
  in an oven, hot enough for bread, till you think it done.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox Cheek.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cover with a strong seasoning of pepper, salt, and minced onion. Bake three or four
  hours, according to its size, then set it by till next day, take off the fat, and warm it as you
  want it. A <i>Shin of beef</i> in the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hare and Rabbit.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Prepare as for roasting, and baste it constantly with butter. The stuffing should
  be rich.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Fawn.</i></p>

  <p>Put a caul over and set it in the oven; about a quarter of an hour before it is done, take off
  the caul and baste well with butter. It will bake in the same time that a pig requires.</p>

  <p>Meat pies require the oven to be as hot as for joints of meat, yet they should not be scorched.
  They also require time to soak through, or the meat will not be done.</p>

  <p>Fish pies require half an hour less baking than the same sized meat pies.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Great nicety is required in baking fruit pies and light pastry. All these ought to
  be baked at home; when the precise heat of the oven, required, may be attained, which it rarely
  can be at the bakehouse. Pastry suffers, too, in being exposed to the air on its way to the oven;
  and it ought not to wait long before it is baked.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pork.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">Any joint will bake well. It must be scored. Rub it over with oil, or stick bits of
  butter all over it. Put it on a stand, and put peeled potatoes under it; also, you may put onions
  and apples. Sprinkle dry sage over, before you serve it. Stuff the pork, or not, as you
  choose.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="X. Broiling" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER X.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">BROILING.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">This</span> is seldom excelled in, though it appears simple, and is of general
  utility; for few like to dine on cold meat, and none dislike a broil. There is no economy in
  broiling, but such meat, poultry, or game, as cannot be hashed with advantage, had best be
  broiled.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The great art in broiling is to have a suitable fire. It must be strong, bright,
  and clear, and entirely free from smoke; if half burnt down, so much the better. Have two
  gridirons, one for meat and poultry, the other for fish. Those which hang before the fire are
  useful. A gridiron should be rubbed clean immediately after being used, not set aside with a
  particle of grease or soot attached to it. Just before you lay meat on, after you have made it
  hot, rub the gridiron with a piece of fresh suet, if for meat; if for fish, rub with chalk. A pair
  of steak-tongs is indispensable. Above all things, it is necessary that the broil be served
  immediately, closely covered on its way from the fire to the table, and that the plates and the
  dish be hot.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Steaks.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">These are eaten in perfection in England only, and, it is said, best in the
  Chop-houses in London, where daily practice makes the cooking perfect, and because in London the
  best beef may always be procured. No skill in broiling will render tough meat tender. Steaks are
  best from the middle of the rump (unless it be the under part of the sirloin), after the meat has
  been killed five days (if the weather permit), or even longer. They should be of about  of an
  inch in thickness; beat them a very little. Sprinkle a little salt over the fire, lay the steaks
  on the hot gridiron, <span class="pagenum" id="page84">{84}</span>turn them frequently, and when
  the fat blazes and smokes much, quickly remove the gridiron for an instant, till it be over, and
  the steak will be sufficiently done, in from ten to fifteen minutes. Have a hot dish by the side
  of the fire; and, to gratify the taste of some persons, rub it with a piece of eschalot; at all
  events let the dish be <i>hot</i>, and as you turn the steaks, if there be any gravy at the top,
  drop it into the dish. Before you dish them, put a piece of fresh butter, and a spoonful of catsup
  in the dish; then sprinkle the dish with a little salt, lay the steaks in the dish, and turn them
  once or twice, to express the gravy. Garnish with horse-radish, or pickles. Oyster, and many other
  sauces may be served; some beef steak eaters say that its own gravy, pepper and salt, are all that
  a good beef steak requires, unless it be a little sliced raw onion or tarragon; others like fried
  onions.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Steaks, with Potatoes.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beat them flat; season on both sides with pepper, salt, and such mixed spices as
  you choose; dip the steaks in melted butter, lay them on the gridiron, and broil them, as directed
  in the last receipt. Have a little finely-rubbed parsley, or chopped eschalot, a piece of butter,
  and some pepper and salt, in a hot dish; when the steaks are done, lay them in it, turn them once
  or twice, and arrange slices of potatoes fried, round them. <i>Or</i>: spread mashed potatoes
  quite hot in the dish, and lay the steaks on.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Blade bone of Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Broil it till quite done. Serve it with stewed mushrooms, or a garnish of pickled
  mushrooms and slices of lemon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mutton and Lamb Chops, also Rabbit and Fowl cut up, Sweetbread and
  Kidneys.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">These may all be broiled in the same way as plain beef steak. Take care that the
  fat which drops from mutton and lamb, does not smoke the chops; where there is danger, take off
  the gridiron, and hold it aslant over the fire. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page85">{85}</span>Kidneys must, to prevent their curling, be stretched on a skewer. They may
  be dressed in a more savoury way, thus: dip them in egg, then in a mixture of bread-crumbs, and
  savoury herbs, before you put them on the gridiron. For mutton, a piece of butter in a hot dish,
  with a little catsup, is good sauce; but no catsup for lamb; cucumber sauce is
  better.&mdash;(<i>See Blade bone of Pork.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pork Chops</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Require a very strong fire, and more cooking than mutton, for they must be well
  done, about a quarter of an hour; cut them once to ascertain the state they are in. Mix in a
  <i>little</i> gravy, rather thin than rich, a spoonful of made mustard; pour this quite hot, over
  the chops, in the dish, to mix with their own gravy; then strew over them a little dry sage,
  rubbed small, and some chopped eschalot. Pork chops may be dressed in a Dutch oven.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Blade bone of Pork.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut it with a small quantity of meat to it: lay it on the gridiron, and when nearly
  done, pepper and salt it well, then rub a piece of butter over, and serve it directly. Mutton in
  the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Chickens and Pigeons.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">After a chicken is picked, singed and washed, or wiped clean, truss, and lay it
  open, by splitting down the back; season the inside with pepper and salt, and lay that side on the
  gridiron, at a greater distance from the fire than you put a steak, for it will take longer to
  cook; at least half an hour is necessary for a good sized chicken. From time to time remove the
  chicken from the fire, and rub it over with a piece of butter, tied in muslin. Run a knife into
  the breast to ascertain if it be done. The gizzard should be scored, well seasoned, broiled and
  divided, to garnish the chicken, with the liver, and slices of lemon. Serve mushroom sauce or
  parsley and butter. You may egg the chicken and strew grated bread over it, and broil till it is
  of a fine brown; take care that the fleshy side is not <span class="pagenum"
  id="page86">{86}</span>burnt. Pigeons are broiled in the same way, or may be done whole; in which
  case truss and put inside each a large piece of butter, pepper and salt, tie close at both ends,
  lay them on the gridiron, and turn them frequently. You may brush them with egg, and roll them in
  bread-crumbs and chopped parsley, with which mixture dredge them whilst broiling. Parsley and
  butter in the dish, with mushroom catsup, if you like. Stewed mushrooms are served with these, or
  pickled mushrooms as garnish. Chickens should be skinned before they are broiled for a sick
  person.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Partridges.</i></p>

  <p>Prepare as above, and place them in a frying-pan in which you have melted a little very
  delicate dripping, or butter; let them stay ten minutes; turn them once, finish on the gridiron;
  this makes them more firm than they would otherwise be. Poor man's sauce (<i>see Sauces</i>) is
  good with all broiled birds.</p>

  <p>(<i>See in Index for Devils, also in Made Dishes, for Cutlets.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">FRYING.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Not</span> so difficult to <i>fry</i> as it is to <i>broil</i> well, and it is
  quite as good, for some things, but the fat must be good. Lard, butter, dripping, topfat (i.e. the
  cake of fat which is taken off soup or broth, when it has stood a night), oil, and suet, are all
  good for frying. If butter, suet and dripping be clarified, the pan will not be so apt to burn,
  and the fat will be more delicate. Housekeepers lose much of their credit by neglecting this, and
  similar niceties. The pan should be thick at the bottom: an oval shape is best, particularly for
  fish. The fire not fierce, as fat soon scorches, and the meat may be burnt, before it is half
  cooked; neither must it be too slack, for then the meat will be soddened; and if fish, of a bad
  colour, and not crisp. Ascertain the heat by throwing a bit of bread in; if the pan be too hot the
  bread will be burnt up. The fat in which veal, lamb or sweetbreads have been fried, will do for
  fish; let it stand to settle, then pour the top carefully from the sediment, and put it by.
  Fritters, pastry or sweet things, must be fried in good butter, lard or oil.</p>

  <p>Care is required to fry fish well, and is attainable only by practice. To ascertain the heat of
  the pan, dip the tail of the fish into the boiling fat, and if it crisps quickly, the pan is
  ready.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fries, as well as broils, served hot, as soon as off the fire, or they will be
  spoiled.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Clarify Butter.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut in pieces, and put it into a jar: set that in a kettle of boiling water, to
  melt; skim carefully, take the jar out of the water, let the butter cool a little, then pour it
  gently off, keeping back the milky sediment.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page88">{88}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Suet.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Chop beef, mutton, or veal suet, take off all skin and fibrous parts, melt it
  <i>slowly</i>, as in the last receipt, or in a Dutch oven, before the fire. Strain, and pour it
  off: beef or mutton dripping may be done the same way, and is good for peas soup, and for plain
  pastry. For soup, it may be seasoned, after it is melted and strained. A piece of charcoal will
  remove a rancid taste, put into the melting fat, and stirred round a few minutes. Use butter or
  lard in frying white meat.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Steaks and Mutton Chops</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Must be fried in butter. Steaks the size directed for broiling will be done in from
  ten to fifteen minutes. When nearly done, cover with a dish and let the pan remain five minutes by
  the fire, after you take it off. Then lay the steaks in a hot dish, and add to the gravy in the
  pan a piece of butter rolled in flour, a glass of port wine, or some catsup, a very little water,
  pepper, salt, a little minced eschalot or onion; let this boil, then pour it over the steaks.
  Garnish with horse-radish, and serve mashed potatoes and pickles. (<i>See Made Dishes, for
  Cutlets.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal Cutlets</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">May be cut from the fillet or the loin,  an inch thick: brush them over with egg,
  cover with bread-crumbs, and fry of a nice light brown, in a good deal of butter or lard. You may,
  if you choose, add to the bread-crumbs, a mixture of parsley, lemon thyme, lemon peel, and a
  little nutmeg and cayenne. When done place the cutlets in a hot dish, while you make some gravy in
  the pan; pour all the fat out, and pour in  pint of boiling water, the same of melted butter, and
  let it boil till thickish, then add Harvey sauce, white wine, and any other sauce you like: strain
  this over the cutlets. Garnish with rashers of bacon, curled parsley, and slices of bacon.
  Cutlets, <i>without gravy</i>, may be served round mashed potatoes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lamb and Pork Chops.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pork chops may be cut from neck or loin. Fry the same <span class="pagenum"
  id="page89">{89}</span>as veal, either plain or egged. Garnish with slices of lemon, or crisped
  parsley. Pork chops, egged, are improved, to some persons' tastes, by a little finely chopped
  onion and sage. You may make a sauce thus: put the chops on a dish, keep hot while you pour part
  of the fat from the pan, stir in a tea-spoonful of flour, moisten  pint of water, or broth, a
  table-spoonful of vinegar, a little salt and pepper, and 6 small gherkins or slices (or <i>for
  lamb, pickled mushrooms</i>), put the chops back into the pan to re-warm in the sauce, and serve
  it altogether. You may add mustard to the sauce; also, chopped onions, for pork. If there be no
  herbs used before, you may sprinkle dried parsley over lamb chops in the dish; also, lemon
  peel.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sausages.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Some suppose that these do not require fat to fry them. It should be butter or
  dripping, not lard (a little for beef or pork, more for veal), and sausages ought to cook slowly,
  that they may be done, without being scorched, and not burst. Prick them with a darning needle to
  prevent this, but gradual heating is the best preventative. Drain, <i>very</i> lightly flour, and
  set them before the fire to froth. For dinner or supper, serve mashed potatoes with sausages.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rabbits</i></p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Must</i> be young, either tame or wild. Carve in joints, brush these with egg,
  and dip them in bread-crumbs, in which there may be, if you like it, some dried parsley, grated
  ham or lemon peel; fry nicely and serve with rashers; make some gravy in the pan as directed for
  veal cutlets.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eggs with Ham or Bacon.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak the slices, of ham or bacon, in lukewarm water, and dry them in the folds of a
  cloth; and they will be less hard than fried bacon usually is. The pan used to fry eggs should be
  delicately clean. A good method is, to melt a little fat in the pan, pour that off, and then,
  whilst the pan is quite hot, rub it hard with a cloth. Let the bacon be nearly done, and if the
  fat be burnt, pour that off, and put in some fresh; then slip the eggs gently in. When they <span
  class="pagenum" id="page90">{90}</span>are done lay the slices of bacon in a dish, trim the eggs,
  and lay them on the bacon. The eggs may be fried in one pan, and the bacon in another; some prefer
  the latter broiled. For breakfast, slices of ham or bacon should not be broiled or fried, but
  toasted before the fire.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sweetbreads.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Parboil them while fresh, and then fry them in long slices, or whole, in plain
  butter; or else egged, covered with bread-crumbs, and seasoned with lemon peel, pepper, and a
  sprig of basil. Garnish with crisped parsley, and lemon sliced: serve on a toast, with either
  parsley and butter, or plain butter, and a very little walnut, mushroom or any other catsup.
  Garnish with small slices of crisped bacon. (<i>See Made Dishes.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox, Calves', and Lamb's Liver, and Pig's Harslet</i>,</p>

  <p class="sp3">Must be quite sound. Cut the liver in long thin slices, soak in water, then dry
  them in a cloth, flour, and season with pepper, salt, a little onion, or eschalot and sage,
  chopped fine. Fry the slices in butter or lard, of a light brown, and when nearly done, put into
  the pan some slices of bacon. When you take the liver and bacon out of the pan, pour in a
  tea-cupful of boiling water, dredge some flour in, let it boil up, and pour this gravy over the
  liver. You may fry a handful of parsley in the gravy. You may improve this gravy, by adding to it
  pepper, salt, a wineglass of vinegar, lump of sugar, and a tea-spoonful of made mustard. Garnish
  with crisped parsley; serve mashed potatoes, or better still, stewed cucumbers. Of the pig's
  harslet, the lights, sweetbread, and heart may be parboiled, cut up, and fried with the liver.
  <i>Or</i>:&mdash;After the fashion of <i>Herefordshire</i>, cut in slices, 2 inches thick, the
  liver, griskins, heart, kidney, lights, crow, and some fat of bacon; rub these slices well with a
  seasoning, composed of onions, apples, a <i>little</i> sage, and plenty of pepper and salt; then
  put them on a small spit in alternate slices of lean and fat, cover all over with a pig's caul,
  and roast it three hours, or more, if the harslet be large. When done, remove the caul and pour a
  kettle of boiling water over. Make some gravy of the water that has been poured over, and flavour
  it with port wine, cyder, and walnut catsup. Serve apple sauce. <i>Harslet</i> is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page91">{91}</span>very good stewed in just enough water to make gravy, and
  seasoned well. A little cayenne.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tripe.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boiled tender, cut in long narrow slips, these dipped in a batter of egg and flour,
  and, if you like, a little minced onion and salt. Fry from seven to ten minutes, of a light brown.
  Serve, if approved of, onion sauce.&mdash;(<i>Cow-Heel the same.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Fry Parsley.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">After it has been washed and picked, shake the parsley backwards and forwards in a
  cloth till dry; then put it into a pan of hot fat, and fry it quickly of a light brown; take it
  out with a slice the moment it is crisp&mdash;it will be spoiled if done too much. Lay it on a
  sieve before the fire. Herbs, lemon peel, and onions, must always be chopped fine before they are
  mixed with bread-crumbs to fry. <i>Or</i>: Spread it on paper in a Dutch oven before the fire, and
  turn it often till it is crisp.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Fry Bread Sippets.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut a slice of bread about a  inch thick, divide it into pieces of any shape you
  like. Make some fat quite hot, in the frying-pan, put in the sippets, and fry of a light brown;
  take them up with a slice, and drain them before the fire ten minutes. Take care the pan be not
  hot enough to burn.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Fry Bread Crumbs.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">The bread two days old: rub it into very smooth crumbs, put them into a stew-pan
  with some butter; set it near a moderate fire, and stir them constantly with a wooden spoon, till
  of a fine light brown; spread them on a sieve to drain, and stir occasionally. Serve with roasted
  sweetbreads, small birds, and game, if approved. (<i>See Made Dishes.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">SOUPS AND
  BROTHS.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">The</span> prejudice against French soup, arising from a belief that it must
  be <i>maigre</i>, is as ridiculous as was the assuming that all Frenchmen are the small, thin,
  miserable looking creatures which they used to be represented in caricatures. Soup is nourishing,
  and also economical, as it converts into palatable food, the coarser parts of meat, all trimmings,
  and much that could not be cooked with effect in any other way.</p>

  <p>The French excel, merely because they take such pains in making soup, and not from the quality
  or quantity of their ingredients. A little meat with slow and regular boiling, will produce richer
  soup, than double the quantity, if the soup kettle be suffered to boil fast one quarter of an
  hour, and to stop boiling altogether the next quarter of an hour.&mdash;The fault most common in
  English soup is, the want of the juice of meat, caused by too quick and irregular boiling, to
  remedy which want, recourse is had to pepper, herbs, and wine. It is very easy to vary the
  <i>sort</i> of soup, by making a good clear <i>stock</i>, or what the French call <i>bouillon</i>,
  and the next or following days, flavour it, or add vegetable ingredients to your taste. Soup made
  solely of brown meat or game, without vegetables, will keep better than that made of veal, fowl,
  any vegetable substance, or fish. As the French are great economists in their kitchens, and are
  most scientific cooks, it may not be amiss to recommend their practice.</p>

  <p>Read the directions for boiling meat, for they must be observed in the first process of soup
  making. Always use the softest water; and, as a general rule, give a quart to a pound of meat for
  soup, rather less for gravy. Place the soup-kettle over a moderate fire, that the meat may be
  gradually heated through, which will cause it to swell and become tender; also the water will
  penetrate into it, and <span class="pagenum" id="page93">{93}</span>extract all the gross
  particles, which will then go off in scum. If it be suffered to boil up quickly, it will be just
  as if scorched before the fire, and will never yield any gravy.&mdash;After the soup has been near
  to a boil for half an hour, let it boil <i>gently</i>, to throw up the scum; remove that
  carefully, and when you think no more will appear, put in the vegetables and a little salt: these
  will cause more scum to rise; watch and take it off, then cover the pot close, and place it so, by
  the fire, that it may boil or <i>simmer</i> gently, and not vary its rate of boiling. From four to
  six hours may be enough, but an hour more would not be too much, for the bare meat and vegetables;
  all flavouring ingredients should be allowed the shortest possible time, because their flavour
  evaporates in boiling. Great extravagance is often committed for the want of attention to this,
  for a larger quantity of costly ingredients is used, than need be if they were put in just at the
  proper time. It may be necessary to put in <i>some</i> of these things earlier than others; but
  this must rest with the discretion of the cook. Remember that where catsup is used, care must be
  observed not to give so much salt as where there is none.</p>

  <p>If the soup waste much in boiling, add boiling water. Keep the lid close, and remove it as
  seldom as possible, because so much of the flavour escapes by that means. If the soup be
  over-watered, leave the lid half way off, that some of it may evaporate in steam.</p>

  <p>French cooks, I believe, invariably brown the meat and vegetables first, thus: put a good piece
  of butter in a stew or frying-pan, then the meat and vegetables and a little water (no seasoning),
  set it over a sharp fire, turn it frequently that none of it may burn, or the flavour will be
  spoiled; when it is all browned, put your quantity of water to it. The soup may, perhaps, have a
  finer flavour, but it will not be so clear, for after the meat has been fried the scum will not be
  extracted from it in boiling.</p>

  <p>Thickening may be made of bread-raspings. But that most commonly used, is flour rubbed in
  butter or fat skimmings. Flour or meal is coloured, spread on a plate, in a Dutch oven before the
  fire. Turn it with a spoon till it is of the colour you wish. Keep covered close, for use. Potato
  flour, a table-spoonful, mixed smooth in a cup of water, is a nice thickening. Barley and oatmeal,
  also Indian <span class="pagenum" id="page94">{94}</span>corn meal, in the same quantity.
  Thickening should be put in after that scumming has taken place which the vegetables have made
  necessary. But the French mode of thickening soup is best of all. (<i>See Roux.</i>)</p>

  <p>Some persons boil vegetables by themselves to a mash, and pulp them through a sieve into the
  soup. This helps to thicken it. The fatter the meat, the more of green vegetables, such as leeks
  and greens, may be used. Meat should not be very fat, nor yet all lean, for soup.</p>

  <p>No seasoning whatever, except salt, should be given to plain stock, if not to be eaten the day
  it is made. Thickened soup requires a greater quantity of flavouring ingredients than clear soup,
  as the thickening material absorbs a portion of the flavouring.&mdash;Take care not to
  over-season, for this is a common fault. Of wine, the quantity should not exceed a wine-glassful
  to a quart. The sort must depend upon taste, but claret is best for brown soup; Madeira for Mock
  Turtle; Brandy is used in soup, and so is lump sugar. Vegetable soup requires a little
  cayenne.</p>

  <p>Soup or stock to be eaten on the following day, should stand by the side of the fire a quarter
  of an hour to settle, before it is strained; the fat skimmed carefully off, and put by. Strain the
  stock into an unglazed vessel. In hot weather, let it stand in a cool place; if you wish to keep
  it three or four days, boil it up every day. When you rewarm it, take off the cake of fat at the
  top, and hold back the sediment. Be careful in warming soup, that it do not get smoked. Also
  remember that it should but just come to a boil, and be taken off the fire, for every bubble tends
  to flatten its flavour. When macaroni, or other paste, or any kind of green vegetable, is added at
  the time of re-warming the soup, of course time must be given for such addition to be cooked; it
  is best partly cooked by itself first.</p>

  <p>Ham is used for making stock; but except for ragouts, or sauces very highly flavoured, I should
  reject it.</p>

  <p>When cream is added, it must be boiled first, or it will curdle. Pour it in by degrees,
  stirring all the while.</p>

  <p>The French use earthenware soup-kettles, and some prefer them to the cast-iron digester, or
  stock-pot. Tammis cloths (bought at the oil shops) are better for straining than sieves.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Never use stale meat for broth or soup. Vegetables as <span class="pagenum"
  id="page95">{95}</span>fresh as possible. The older and drier the onion, the stronger its
  flavour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Plain Stock.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Having read the foregoing directions, get a leg or shin of beef, break it in two or
  three places, wash it, and cut some nice pieces to eat. Cover with water, and boil it slowly. If
  you wish it to be very good, add an old fowl, rabbit, any trimmings of meat, or gizzards of
  poultry, or bones, but mind that whatever it be, it is quite fresh; take care that you take off
  the first scum as it rises, then put in salt, and a large carrot, a head of celery, two turnips,
  and two onions. Simmer this so gently as not to waste the liquor, from four to five hours, then
  strain as directed.&mdash;Rabbits are excellent in making stock. More onions may be used than I
  have given directions for in this receipt; indeed, where their flavour is not objected to, it is
  scarcely possible to use too many, for nothing enriches soup and gravy so much. The meat of shin
  of beef is excellent for your family dinner; before what is cut into smallish pieces are cooked
  too much, take them out and keep hot to serve with a little of the soup poured over, as sauce.
  Serve pickles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Soup and Bouilli.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">About 5 lbs. of fresh, juicy rump, or flank of beef, four quarts of water, let it
  come slowly to a boil, put in a heaped table-spoonful of salt, taking off all the scum carefully;
  put in three carrots, four turnips, two leeks, one head of celery, three onions (one burnt), three
  cloves in each, a small bunch of herbs; this should boil very gently five hours. All the
  vegetables cut or sliced. Some persons like a small cabbage cut up in this. Serve the bouilli
  garnished with the vegetables; put slices of bread in your tureen and pour the soup over, without
  straining. Tomata sauce is good with bouilli.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Good Plain Stock.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">7 lbs. of knuckle of veal cut in pieces, five inches in diameter, also  lb. of
  lean ham, cut in dice, put  lb. of butter into a stew-pan, turn it round, then put in the meat,
  two <span class="pagenum" id="page96">{96}</span>onions, four cloves in each, a turnip, carrot,
  leek and a head of celery. Cover the pan and keep skimming its contents over a sharp fire, until
  there be a thick white glaze that will adhere to the spoon; then put in four quarts of soft water,
  and when coming to a boil, set it on one side of the fire, that it may <i>simmer</i> for three
  hours. Skim off the fat, and strain it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Very good Clear Gravy Soup.</i></p>

  <p>First heat, then rub with a coarse cloth, a good-sized stew-pan or stock-pot, then rub the
  bottom and sides with a marrow, or a large piece of butter. Lay in about 6 or 7 lbs. of shin of
  beef chopped across, a knuckle or scrag of veal, four shanks or the knuckle part of a leg of
  mutton, and any trimmings of meat, game or poultry you have, a slice of carrot, a head of celery,
  two onions, two leeks, and turnip sliced, and two table-spoonsful of salt. Let this catch, not
  burn, over a rather brisk fire, and add five quarts of soft water. When it has been carefully
  scummed once, give it a pint of cold water, to throw up more scum. Simmer slowly full four hours.
  Place it by the side of the hearth to settle, skim off the fat, and strain it. Of this soup, which
  ought to be very clear, are made many sorts, on following days, thus<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p><i>Vermicelli.</i>&mdash;Boil the quantity you wish to use, in a little water, till nearly
  cooked enough, then put it into the clear soup, when you put that on the fire to re-warm. <i>Brown
  thickening, which see, in the Index.</i></p>

  <p><i>Maccaroni Soup.</i>&mdash;The same as the last, but do not make it too thick. Boil the
  maccaroni till rather more than three parts cooked, and put it into the soup to finish while that
  is heating. Cream is an improvement. Serve grated parmesan. <i>White thickening.</i></p>

  <p><i>Carrot or Turnip Soup.</i>&mdash;Cut red carrots in thin strips, boil them till tender, and
  put them into clear soup, when it is rewarmed. <i>Or</i>: Boil six or eight carrots quite tender,
  then pulp them through a sieve into the soup. Scoop turnips into little balls, or cut them in any
  shapes you like, boil them till tender, and put into the soup. <i>Brown thickening.</i></p>

  <p><i>Celery and Asparagus Soup.</i>&mdash;Cut these in pieces rather more than  an inch in
  length, and boil them gently, till <span class="pagenum" id="page97">{97}</span>tender, then put
  them into clear gravy soup. Cream may be used if the thickening be white.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Julienne Soup.</i>&mdash;Cut leeks and celery in squares, turnips and carrots in
  strips, boil them till tender, and put into clear brown soup. <i>Or</i>: Cut carrots and turnips
  in strips, put a large tea-cupful of these into a stewpan with  lb. of butter, and shake it over
  the fire till they are tender and look transparent, then pour in the stock; add young peas, two
  onions, two leeks, a small lettuce, some sorrel and chervil, all these cut small; simmer gently
  till the vegetables are cooked, then put in three lumps of sugar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Clear Herb Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut up what herbs you like the flavour of; also leeks, celery, carrots, turnips,
  cabbage, lettuce, and young onions, in preference to old ones, a handful of young peas, put the
  whole into boiling water, and give them just a scald. Drain them on a sieve, put them into some
  clear stock, and simmer slowly till the roots are tender. Season with salt, and a very little
  cayenne, if you choose.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Clear Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp4">Cut 6 lbs. of gravy beef small, put it into a large stewpan, with two onions, a
  small carrot and turnip, a head of celery, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a pint of water. Stew
  slowly an hour, add nine pints of boiling water. Simmer it slowly six hours, strain, and let it
  stand till next day. Take off the fat, pour it from the sediment, and boil up with whatever
  flavouring ingredient you choose. This may be made <i>Julienne</i> by putting in the mixture of
  vegetables as directed above. Also <i>Ox-tail</i> by adding one to it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Brown Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make this as clear gravy soup, and strain it. Then fry to a nice brown 2 lbs. rump
  steaks, cut in small pieces, drain them from the fat, and put them in the soup. Let them simmer an
  hour, add salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste, also a wine-glassful of any catsup you like, and
  when done, let it stand by the fire, to allow the fat to rise; take that off, and serve the soup
  with the steaks.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page98">{98}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Plain White Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak a large knuckle of veal, put it into the soup-kettle with 2 fowls skinned, or
  a rabbit,  lb. of lean undressed bacon or ham, a bunch of lemon thyme, 2 onions, 1 carrot, 1
  turnip, a head of celery, a few white peppercorns, and 2 blades of mace, cover with water, and
  boil for two hours and a half, and strain. This should form a jelly. To re-warm it, take off the
  top fat, clear the soup from the sediment, and put it in a stewpan. Add vermicelli or maccaroni,
  previously boiled, till nearly done.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another White Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Fry 2 lbs. veal, and  lb. ham or bacon, with a faggot of herbs, 2 onions, a
  parsnip cut small, and a head of celery. When the gravy is drawn, pour upon it 2 quarts of water,
  and 2 quarts of skim milk. Boil it slowly an hour and a half. Add 2 table-spoonfuls of oatmeal,
  rubbed smooth in a tea-cupful of broth. Boil half an hour, then strain it into the tureen. <i>Cow
  heel</i> and <i>calf's feet</i> are good in making white soup; also rabbits, in place of fowls.
  When veal is dear, use lean beef.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another with herbs.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil a quart of beef and a quart of veal stock together, with a table-spoonful of
  chopped tarragon, and one of chervil; when tender, have ready a coffee-cupful of cream and three
  eggs beaten together, stir them gently in, and keep stirring till cooked, but do not let it
  boil.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lorraine Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Blanch  lb. of sweet and 1 oz. bitter almonds, pound them in a mortar, with a very
  little water, to a paste. Take all the white part of a cold roast fowl, skin and mince it very
  fine, with the yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs, and some fine bread-crumbs; put this into a pint of
  <i>plain white soup</i>, with a large piece of lemon peel, and a little mace and nutmeg; let it
  come to a boil, add a quart more of the same stock boiling hot, and after it has simmered a few
  minutes, strain the soup, and add, by degrees, a quart of cream which has been boiled.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page99">{99}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Onion Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The number of onions must depend upon taste; if 10 or 12, chop and stew them, in a
  saucepan, with a good piece of butter; stew them gradually, and when done, add some good stock:
  salt, pepper, and cayenne, if the stock be not already seasoned. This may be strained, and a pint
  of boiling cream added, to make it more delicate.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: cut small silver onions in
  rings, fry them of a light colour, drain and cook them for twenty minutes in <i>clear gravy
  soup</i>. Serve toasted sippets.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Onion Soup Maigre.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Fry in clarified butter 12 large onions, 2 heads of celery, a large carrot and a
  turnip, all chopped. When soft, pulp them through a sieve, into 2 quarts of boiled water,
  thickened with 4 or 5 oz. of butter, worked up with potato flour, and seasoned with mace and white
  peppercorns, 2 lumps of sugar, or you may thicken with the beat yolks of 4 eggs. Bread sippets in
  the tureen.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Peas Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">An old-fashioned, but good receipt. Boil quite soft, 3 pints of green peas, and
  work them through a hair sieve. Put into the water in which the peas were boiled, 3 large slices
  of ham, a small knuckle of veal, a few beet leaves shred small, a turnip, 2 carrots, and a little
  more water. Boil an hour and a half. Then strain the liquor into a bowl, and mix it with the pulp.
  Put in a little juice of spinach, which is obtained by squeezing the spinach, after it has been
  boiled, through a cloth. This will give a good colour. Then give it a gentle boil, to take off the
  taste of the spinach, slice in the whitest part of a head of celery, and a lump of sugar the size
  of a walnut. Cut a slice of bread into little square pieces, a slice of bacon in the same manner,
  and fry together in fresh butter, of a light brown. Cut a large lettuce in slices, fry that, after
  the other, then put them all together into the tureen. Have ready boiled, a pint of young peas,
  put them also into the tureen, and pour the soup over.&mdash;Onions may be added if
  approved.&mdash;Serve toasted bread, and also dry powdered mint.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page100">{100}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Pea or Asparagus Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put 5 pints of peas, with  lb. of butter and  lb. lean ham, in dice, into a
  stew-pan with two onions cut up and a little parsley, moisten it with water, and keep stirring or
  shaking over a sharp fire; when quite tender put in a thickening of flour rubbed smooth with water
  or broth, and having stirred that well in, add 3 quarts of any stock you have; whatever salt and
  pepper you think is required, also cayenne if you like, and 3 lumps of sugar: boil ten minutes and
  strain it. This may be served at once; or, after you have strained it, you may boil it up again
  with  pint of boiling milk, skim it, and serve on crisp sippets. <i>Asparagus</i> the same way:
  keep back part of the heads, and boil them separately, not very tender, cut them in pointed
  pieces, and put into the strained soup.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Artichoke Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash and peel 2 doz. Jerusalem artichokes, and cut them in thin slices. Put 2 large
  onions, 1 turnip, a head of celery, 2 bay leaves, a sprig of thyme, and 1 lb. of lean ham into a
  stew-pan, with  lb. butter, stir all the time, and let it fry over a slow fire 20 minutes; it
  will form a white glaze, then take it off, and put it all with the artichokes into a stew-pan with
  a pint of thin broth or soft water, and simmer it, till all the vegetables are quite tender, then
  put in 3 table-spoonsful of flour rubbed smooth with broth, mix well together; add 3 quarts of
  good stock and a pint of boiled milk, a tea-spoonful of salt, the same of sugar, let it just boil
  up, then strain it, and boil it up again with mushroom catsup, and a glass of white wine; and pour
  it over fried bread in the tureen.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A good Maigre Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Melt slowly, in a stew-pan,  lb. butter, put in a head of celery, 1 carrot, and 1
  turnip sliced, shake them well and let them brown; add three quarts of boiling water, 1 pint of
  young peas, and some black pepper; when these are done, let it settle, strain the soup into
  another stew-pan, leaving all sediment; put it on again with 3 large onions in slices, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page101">{101}</span>another head of celery, and 3 turnips and carrots in
  pretty shapes. Boil slowly till done, then serve the soup.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Yellow Peas Soup</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Should soak the night before, and if old, again in the morning, in lukewarm water.
  Allow 1 lb. to 4 quarts of soft water, with 3 lbs. of lean sinewy beef, or fresh trimmings of
  meat, poultry, or roast beef bones, a small piece of pickled pork, the shank of a bacon or mutton
  ham, or the root of a tongue a little salted, and soaked and washed; also 2 carrots, 2 turnips,
  and 6 rather small onions. Scum well, as soon as it boils, and stir the peas up from the bottom;
  add another quart of boiling water, or the liquor of any boiled meat. (Pot liquor should always be
  saved for peas soup.) Let it simmer till the peas will pulp. Then strain through a coarse sieve.
  Take the onions out from the pulp, and put the latter back into the soup, with a fresh head of
  celery, or a large tea-spoonful of celery seed, tied in muslin, and some salt and pepper. Simmer
  it, if thin, three-quarters of an hour, to thicken it; then put it into the tureen, let it stand
  covered a few minutes, and remove the fat which will have gathered on the top. Shake dried mint or
  parsley over the soup, and serve with dice of toasted bread.&mdash;This soup may be made in a very
  economical way, by the means of pot liquor, roast beef bones, fragments of meat, and fresh
  clarified dripping. The liquor in which a leg of pork has been boiled, should be saved for peas
  soup.&mdash;Very little pieces of boiled pork may be served in peas soup, also cucumbers cut and
  fried, or bacon cut and fried. A pickled herring is used to give flavour, when there is no pot
  liquor. Peas soup is very good quite maigre; the water must be soft, and the peas boiled long and
  slowly, before they are pulped.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Carrot Soup plain.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scrape and wash six large carrots, and peel off the outsides quite thick; put these
  into a soup-kettle, with a large head of celery, an onion cut thin, two quarts of soft water, or
  pot liquor, and, if you have them, roast beef bones. After this has been boiled and scummed, set
  it by the fire, keep it close covered and simmer it gently two hours. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page102">{102}</span>Strain through a sieve, and pulp the vegetables, with a wooden spoon,
  into a clean saucepan, and as much broth as will make it as thick as peas soup; season with salt
  and pepper. Make it hot, and send it to table. Add what spices you like. Serve toasted bread,
  either fried or plain.&mdash;<i>Celery</i> and <i>Turnip</i> soup the same way. When celery cannot
  be procured, the seed pounded fine, about  a drachm, put in a quarter of an hour, will give the
  flavour of two heads of celery.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mock Turtle Soup.</i></p>

  <p>Make it the day before it is wanted. Get a good sized calf's head, the skin on, scald and split
  it, take out the brains, and the bones of the nose, and lay it in lukewarm water to soak. Change
  the water often, to draw out the blood and slime. When the head is quite clean, put it into a
  stew-pan with rather more soft cold water than to cover it. Let it come to a boil rather quickly,
  and scum well. Then boil gently, rather more than half an hour. Take out the head, place it in a
  dish, and when cold, cut it into small neat pieces: skin the tongue, and cut it up. Keep the meat
  covered, and set it by till the next day. Put all the bones and refuse parts of the head into the
  soup-kettle, in the liquor in which it was boiled, with a knuckle of veal broken, and about 3 lbs.
  shin of beef, but the latter must be soaked first. Let this boil, then take off all the scum, and
  simmer it gently from four hours and a half to six hours, strain it into a pan, and set it by.
  When you want to make the soup, take off the cake of fat, and pour the stock into a large
  stew-pan, holding back the sediment; set it on the fire, let it come quickly to a boil, then throw
  in a little salt to facilitate the rising of whatever scum there may still be, and take this off.
  Put in from 10 to 12 sliced onions, browned in the frying-pan; also a few sprigs of fried sage, a
  few leaves of sweet basil, and the peel of a large lemon, not fried; a little cayenne, black
  pepper to your taste, a very little allspice, three blades of mace, some cloves, one eschalot, and
  the thickening; which latter may be of flour worked up in butter, or of brown <i>roux</i> (which
  <i>see in the Index</i>). Let it simmer nearly two hours, or till it taste strong, and be of a
  good colour; pass it gently through a hair-sieve into another stew-pan, and put into that the cut
  <span class="pagenum" id="page103">{103}</span>up pieces of head, and what wine you choose,
  Madeira, sherry, or claret, about a wine-glassful of either of the two former, to a quart of soup.
  When the meat is tender, the soup is done, and from half to three-quarters of an hour ought to
  cook it.</p>

  <p>Have ready 12 each of forcemeat and egg balls to serve in the tureen. <i>Forcemeat balls</i>
  are made of veal or fowl, suet and parsley, all minced very fine, mixed with bread-crumbs, salt,
  pepper, cayenne, lemon-peel, nutmeg, and allspice, and wetted with yoke of egg, to make up into
  balls. Fry of a light brown, and lay them in a small sieve to drain before you put them in the
  tureen. <i>Egg balls</i> are eggs boiled hard, the yoke taken from the white and pounded well in a
  mortar, a little salt added, and as much raw yolk of egg and flour as will bind these into balls,
  not bigger than a marble. Put them into the soup soon enough to cook them. Before you serve the
  soup, squeeze the juice of a lemon into the tureen.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Some persons put ox palates, in slices, in mock turtle; pickled cucumbers cut very
  thin may also be an improvement. The above is not an expensive receipt, though, perhaps, quite
  rich enough. <i>Cheaper Mock Turtle</i> may be made of cow-heels or calf's feet, stewed gently,
  strained, and the liquor added to plain stock of beef, an onion, and what herbs and other
  seasonings you like. Cut up the feet, and put them into the soup, just before you serve it. Add
  lemon juice and wine, if you like.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hare Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The hare must be quite fresh. Cut it up (washed, but not soaked), put it in a
  stewpan, with six middling-sized onions (two burnt), two bay leaves, a blade of mace, three
  cloves, a bunch of parsley, a little sweet basil, thyme, and celery, also a little broth, plain
  stock, or, if you have neither, soft water, to cover the meat. If you desire it to be very good,
  add 1 lb. of gravy beef, notched and browned first; when it has come to a boil, and been scummed,
  put in three quarts of water, and simmer, if the hare be young, three hours; if old, longer.
  Strain it, set the best pieces cut rather small apart, to serve in the tureen, and cut all the
  meat off the other parts, to pound with soaked crumb of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page104">{104}</span>bread, to give thickness to the soup. When this is put into the strained
  soup, season it to your taste, and add catsup and port wine; also fried forcemeat balls, if you
  like.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another, and a better.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If you happen to have two hares, one old and tough, the other young, cut up the
  first and put it on in three quarts of water, with three onions, two anchovies, six cloves, a
  blade of mace, a teaspoonful of salt, half a one of cayenne, and simmer it four hours. Meantime,
  roast the other hare, properly stuffed, till half done, then cut it up, and put it all, with the
  stuffing, into the soup, and let it simmer gently nearly an hour. You will have kept back some of
  the best pieces to serve in the soup the next day, unless you prefer it clear without any meat, in
  which case put it all in. Next day, when you re-warm it, add a tumbler of port wine. Not having
  the old hare, two rabbits may be found very good.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rabbit Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut up the rabbits, and if two, put the pieces into water sufficient to cover them;
  let it boil slowly, and take off all the scum; when no more rises, add two quarts of good stock
  (or soft water), prepared of shin of beef and veal, or of knuckle of veal alone, or of trimmings
  of veal and two or three shanks of mutton: this stock must be already flavoured with onions or
  eschalots, white peppercorns, and mace; simmer gently till the meat is quite tender, and then put
  it by till next day. Take off all fat before you re-warm it; take out the liver, rub it through a
  sieve, moisten with a little flour and butter, and add to the soup, also a teacupful of Port, the
  same of white wine, a table-spoonful of walnut catsup, and lemon pickle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Game and Venison Soup</i>,</p>

  <p class="sp3">May be made of any and of every kind of game. Skin the birds; if large ones, carve
  them; if small ones, only split down the back; fry them, with slices of ham or bacon, and a
  <i>little</i> sliced onion and carrot. Drain the pieces, lay them in a stewpan with some good
  <i>stock</i>, a head of celery, a little chopped parsley, and what seasonings you like. Stew
  gently <span class="pagenum" id="page105">{105}</span>for an hour. If venison be at hand, fry some
  small steaks, and stew with the birds. Serve the meat in the soup, taking out the ham.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another, and plainer.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">In the season, and in houses where game abounds, make soup as follows: cut the meat
  off the breasts of any cold birds, and pound it in a mortar. Boil the legs, and all the bones, in
  whatever broth you have, for an hour. Boil four large turnips to a mash, and pulp them to the
  pounded meat, mix these well, then strain in the broth, by degrees, and let it stand close by the
  fire, in the stew-pan, but do not let it boil. Season to your taste. Just before you serve it,
  beat the yolks of 6 eggs in a pint of cream, and pass through a sieve; then put the soup on the
  fire, and as it is coming to a boil, stir in the cream, and keep stirring a few minutes, but do
  not let it quite boil, or it will curdle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Stewed Knuckle of Veal and Soup</i>,</p>

  <p class="sp3">May be made of the breast, shoulder-blade, or scrag, but best of the knuckle. Cut
  it in three pieces: wash, break, and place it on skewers, in the stew-pan, with 1 lb. of streaked
  bacon, a head of celery, 4 onions, 2 carrots, 1 turnip, a bunch of parsley and lemon thyme, and a
  few black and Jamaica peppercorns. Cover the meat with water, and let it simmer till quite tender.
  Strain the soup, put it on the fire again, and season and thicken it to your taste. Either serve
  the meat in the tureen with the soup, or put it in a dish with the bacon, and the vegetables round
  it. You may pour parsley and butter over the meat, or serve it in a boat. A little rice flour is
  good to thicken with. Some have whole rice boiled, as for eating, and put to the soup when it is
  returned to the fire. Others use vermicelli. Eggs and cream beaten together and strained, would
  enrich this soup; when you put them in, stir all the time, and take off the soup before it quite
  boils.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mulligatawny Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put a few slices of bacon into a stew-pan with a knuckle of veal, and no
  vegetables; simmer an hour and three <span class="pagenum" id="page106">{106}</span>quarters; cut
  about 2 lbs. of breast of veal into rather small pieces, add the bones, and gristly parts of the
  breast, to the knuckle which is stewing; fry the pieces of meat, and 6 sliced onions, in a
  stew-pan, with a piece of good clarified dripping or butter. Strain the stock if done, and put the
  fry to it, set it on the fire, and scum carefully; simmer it an hour. Have ready mixed in a
  batter, 2 dessert-spoonsful of curry powder, the same of lightly browned flour, and salt and
  cayenne as you choose; add them to the soup. Simmer the meat till quite tender. You may have 2
  chickens parboiled, and use them in place of the breast of veal. The above receipt is a plain
  one.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another and richer.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make a strong stock of a knuckle of veal, roast beef bones, a ham bone, a faggot of
  sweet herbs, 2 carrots, 4 turnips, 8 onions, 1 clove of garlic, 3 heads of celery, previously
  fried in butter, 6 cloves, some black pepper, salt, cayenne, mace, and mushroom powder; stew it
  all in 5 quarts of water, eight hours, then strain through a fine sieve. When cold take off all
  the fat, and if the stock be not rich enough, add to 3 quarts, a pint of good gravy; rub 3
  table-spoonsful of curry powder, 1 of ground rice, and 1 of turmeric with some butter and flour,
  then moisten with a little stock, and add it by degrees to the rest, and simmer it two hours. Add
  2 or 3 wine-glassfuls of sherry or Madeira, 1 of oyster, 1 of walnut pickle, 1 of eschalot or
  chili vinegar, 2 table-spoonsful of soy, 2 of Harvey or Reading sauce, and 1 of essence of
  anchovy; simmer it a few minutes. Have ready 2 chickens, or a rabbit, parboiled, then browned in
  fresh butter, or pieces of ox-tail previously cooked, add whichever of these it may be to the
  soup, simmer it again till the meat be cooked, then squeeze in the juice of a lemon and serve.
  Serve rice, cayenne, chili vinegar, and pickles.&mdash;<i>Cold Arrack</i>, or <i>Rum Punch</i>,
  after mulligatawny.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox-Tail Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Three tails will make a good sized tureen-ful of soup; it is very strengthening, is
  considered an elegant, and is by no means an expensive soup. Have the tails divided at the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page107">{107}</span>points, rub with suet, and soak them in lukewarm water.
  Lay them in a stew-pan with  6 onions, a turnip, 2 carrots, some peppercorns, and 3 quarts of soft
  water. Let it simmer two hours and a half; take out the tails, cut them in small pieces, thicken
  it brown, then strain it into a fresh stew-pan, put in the pieces of meat, boil up and skim it;
  put more pepper, if wanted, and either catsup, or Port wine.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Grouse Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Roast 3 birds, cut off all the meat, reserve some nice pieces to serve in the
  tureen; put the bones and all the rest into 2 quarts of good stock, and boil them half an hour;
  then pound the meat in a mortar; put a large onion,  a carrot and turnip, cut up, into a stew-pan
  with  lb. butter, 2 sprigs each of parsley, thyme, 2 bay leaves, 6 peppercorns, and  a blade of
  mace, and stir them a few minutes over the fire; then add a pint of stock, and stew it all till
  tender, put in the pounded meat, and 4 oz. of flour rubbed smooth, and the soup, mix it all well
  together, simmer it 20 minutes, stirring all the while; if required, add salt, and a
  table-spoonful of sugar; strain it into another stew-pan, boil it up, skim it well, and pour into
  the tureen over the reserved slices of meat, and some fried pieces of bread, cut in any shape you
  please. The <i>stock</i> for the above is good made of 4 or 5 lbs. of beef and 1 or 2 rabbits,
  according to the quantity, and the richness you require. I should put a large wine-glassful of
  Port into a moderate sized tureen-ful.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Partridge and Pheasant Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as the above.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Poacher's Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This excellent soup may be made of any kind of game. About 4 lbs. of any of the
  coarse parts of venison, beef, or the same weight in shanks, or lean mutton, for the stock; boil
  in it celery, onions, carrots, turnips, what herbs you like, and  oz. of mixed black and Jamaica
  peppers. Simmer three hours, then strain it. Skin and cut up a black cock, a woodcock, a pheasant,
  half a hare, a rabbit, a brace <span class="pagenum" id="page108">{108}</span>of partridges, or
  grouse, or slices of venison; any one, or parts of several of these, according to what you may
  require and what game you may have. Season the meat with such mixed spices as you like, then flour
  and fry it in the frying-pan, or put them, at once, into the strained stock, for the frying
  process is not actually necessary. Put in with the pieces of meat, about 10 small onions, 2 heads
  of celery cut up, and 6 peeled potatoes; when the stock comes to a boil, add a small white
  cabbage, or a lettuce quartered, black pepper, salt, and allspice if you like. Simmer till the
  meat be tender. If the meat be composed of small birds, the vegetables must be put into the soup
  and cooked before the meat, for <i>that</i> must not be <i>overdone</i>. This may be enriched by
  wine, catsup, anchovies, and forcemeat balls.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Scotch Barley Broth.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">About 4 lbs. of mutton to 4 quarts of water, and  lb. of Scotch barley (more or
  less according to taste), a large spoonful of salt, also a large cup of soaked split peas, if in
  season. Scum carefully, and let the broth boil slowly an hour. Then add 2 carrots, 2 turnips, cut
  small, 3 onions, or 3 leeks sliced, and a head of celery, or a bunch of parsley, and some green or
  split peas. When these are done, season to your taste. This may be made of beef, with greens
  instead of turnips. The meat, if mutton, is served in a dish, with parsley and butter; and the
  vegetables in the soup. Remove the fat from the top before you serve.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hotchpotch, a German dish.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut 6 lbs. of either beef or mutton, or both, into nice shaped pieces, and put to
  them as much water as you require soup. Boil and scum well, then put in carrots and turnips
  sliced, parsley chopped, leeks and German greens cut up, suiting the quantity to the meat. Serve
  all together.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Pepper Pot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Three quarts of water, 2 lbs. of mutton or veal, and a small piece of lean bacon; a
  fowl if you have it; as many carrots, turnips, and onions as you like, and a tea-cupful of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page109">{109}</span>rice. Scum well, season highly, and let it stand a little
  before you serve it, to take off the fat.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Scotch Cock-a-leekie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make a stock of 5 lbs. of shin of beef, strain, and put to it a large fowl trussed
  for boiling, and when it boils, put in six leeks (blanched), in pieces an inch long. In half an
  hour put in six more leeks and the seasoning; if these leeks do not make the soup thick enough,
  put more. When the fowl is done, serve it in the soup.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mutton Broth.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put 2 lbs. of scrag of mutton into a saucepan, with just enough water to cover, and
  when that is near boiling, pour it off, and carefully take all the scum off the meat; then put it
  back into the saucepan with four pints of boiling water, a table-spoonful of grits, a little salt,
  and an onion; set it over a slow fire, scum well, and then put in two turnips, and simmer it
  slowly two hours. (<i>See Cooking for the Sick.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal Broth.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The knuckle is best, but the scrag is good. A gallon of water to the knuckle, add
  an onion, a blade of mace and salt. Carefully scum, and boil it gently till the meat be thoroughly
  done, and the liquor greatly reduced. Add vermicelli or rice.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Chicken Broth</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Should simmer very gently, and its strength will be in proportion to the quantity
  of water. A good-sized chicken will make a quart of very good broth. As this is seldom made except
  for invalids, neither onion, carrot, nor turnip ought to be used. A bunch of parsley may be boiled
  in the broth, then taken out and chopped fine. Skim the fat off the broth, and serve the parsley
  in it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Milk Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil two quarts with a little salt, cinnamon, and sugar. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page110">{110}</span>Lay thin slices of toasted bread in a tureen, pour a little hot milk over
  them, and cover close that they may soak. Beat the yolks of five eggs, add them by degrees to the
  milk; stir it over the fire till it thickens, take it off instantly or it will curdle; pour it
  into the tureen upon the bread. You may stir into the boiling milk a  lb. of sweet almonds, and a
  few bitter ones, all blanched. In France <i>buttermilk</i> is cooked in this way, and poured on
  thin slices of boiled apples, spread in a tureen.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox-Head Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put half an ox cheek into a tub of cold water, and let it soak two hours. Take it
  out, break the bones not already broken, and wash it well in lukewarm water. Then put it in a pot,
  cover with cold water, and let it boil; scum carefully, put in salt, one head of celery, one
  turnip, two carrots, two large onions (one burnt), a bay leaf, two dozen berries of black pepper,
  the same of allspice, a good handful of parsley, some marjoram, savory, and lemon thyme; cover the
  soup kettle close, and set it over a slow fire. As the liquor is coming to a boil, scum will rise,
  take that off, and let the soup stew gently by the fire three hours. Then take out the head, pour
  the soup through a fine sieve into a stone-ware pan, and set both by till the next day. Cut the
  meat into small pieces, skim all fat from the top of the liquor, and put about two quarts of it,
  all the meat, and a head of celery cut up and fried with an onion, into a clean saucepan, and
  simmer it half an hour. Cayenne may be added, a glass of white wine, or a table-spoonful of
  brandy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Giblet Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scald two sets of fresh giblets, and pick them very clean. Cut off the noses, split
  the heads, and divide the gizzards and necks into small pieces; crack the bones of the legs, put
  all into a stewpan, and cover them with cold water. When it boils scum well, and put in three
  sprigs each of lemon thyme, winter savory, or marjoram, and a little bunch of parsley; also twenty
  berries of allspice, and the same of black pepper, in a muslin bag; let this <i>stew very
  gently</i>, till the gizzards are tender, which will be in about an hour and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page111">{111}</span>a half. Lift out the giblets with a skimmer, or spoon with holes, into a
  tureen, and keep it, covered, by the fire. Melt 1 oz. of fresh butter in a clean saucepan, stir
  in enough flour to make a paste, and pour in, by degrees, a ladleful of the giblet liquor, and the
  rest by degrees, and boil it ten minutes, stirring all the time. Skim and strain the soup through
  a fine sieve into a bason. Rince the stewpan, return the soup into it, and add a glass of Port
  wine, a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, and a little salt. Give it one boil up, put the giblets
  in to get hot, and serve it.&mdash;You may make this much better by using plain stock in place of
  water, and a ham bone. You may add a pint of Madeira also; squeeze a small Seville orange into the
  tureen, and add three lumps of sugar and a little cayenne.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Soup Maigre.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the white part of eight-loaved lettuces small as dice, wash and drain them,
  also a handful of purslain, the same of parsley. Cut six large cucumbers into pieces the size of a
  crown piece, peel and mince four large onions, and have three pints of young peas. Put  lb. of
  fresh butter into a stewpan, brown it of a high colour, and put in all the vegetables, with thirty
  whole peppers, and stew it ten minutes, stirring all the time, to prevent burning. Add a gallon of
  boiling water, and one or two French rolls, cut in three pieces, and toasted of a light brown.
  Cover the stew-pan, and let the soup stew gradually two hours. Put in  drachm of beaten mace, two
  cloves bruised, nutmeg and salt to your taste; boil it up, and just before you serve, squeeze the
  juice of one lemon into it: do not strain it.&mdash;Soup may be made of any, and of every sort of
  vegetable, in the same manner, but they must be thoroughly cooked. Cream is an improvement, and
  French rolls, if not stewed in the soup, may be cut in slices, toasted, and put into the tureen
  before the soup.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Stock for Fish Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This may be made of either meat or fish, the latter for maigre days. If meat, make
  it the same as for meat soup. If fish be used, it may be cod's head, haddocks, whitings, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page112">{112}</span>eels, skate, and all white fish. Boil the fish for stock
  in two quarts of water, with two onions, some salt, a piece of lemon peel, and a bunch of sweet
  herbs. Scum carefully, and strain it. If the soup is to be brown, you may brown the fish for stock
  in the frying-pan before you boil it. Fish stock will not keep.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lobster Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">For this there should be a good stock, of beef, ham, onions, and fresh fish
  trimmings; strain it and pulp back the onions. Pound the spawn and all the body of the lobster,
  and stir it smoothly into the soup. Cut all the meat of the claws in small pieces, and put it in
  the soup also. Add cayenne, white pepper, and a glass of sherry. <i>Or</i>&mdash;Having a stock of
  fish prepared, cut up the meat of the lobster in pieces, and mix the coral with it. Bruise the
  spawn with a little flour in a mortar, wet it with a little of the strained stock, and mix it by
  degrees into the rest. Take half of the cut up meat and coral, add oysters, an anchovy, a blade of
  mace, nutmeg, lemon peel grated, and a little cayenne; pound all together, with the yolks of two
  eggs, and a very little flour, and make forcemeat balls for the soup; fry or brown them in a Dutch
  oven, or use them without being browned or fried. Put the balls and the remainder of the cut up
  meat into the soup, let it simmer half an hour, then serve it, first squeezing half a lemon or
  Seville orange in the tureen. Madeira may be added.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Oyster Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Veal makes the most delicate stock; it should be strong and clear: put to it a
  quart of the hard part of fresh juicy oysters, which have been pounded in a mortar with the yolks
  of six hard-boiled eggs. Simmer for half an hour, then strain it into a fresh stewpan, and put in
  another quart or more of oysters, trimmed, and washed from their shells, also some mace and
  cayenne, and let it simmer ten minutes. Beat the yolks of three eggs, take out a little soup in a
  cup, let it cool, mix it by degrees with the eggs, and stir into the soup, having first drawn that
  aside from the fire; stir all the time until you send it to table, or it will curdle. Give <span
  class="pagenum" id="page113">{113}</span>this soup any additional flavour you like. The oysters
  put in whole, may be first run on fine wire skewers, and fried.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Another Maigre.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Into four pints of water put five onions fried in butter, some mace, salt, pepper,
  and what herbs you like, in a small quantity. When this has boiled, and been carefully scummed,
  put in 1 lb. of fresh butter, a few mushrooms, and a 100 oysters; thicken with vermicelli, and let
  the soup boil gently a quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cray Fish Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If to be maigre, the stock must be made of fish alone; it must be quite fresh, and
  3 lbs. will make two quarts; put in an onion or two, and some black and Jamaica peppers. Boil the
  fish to a mash, and keep straining the liquor till clear. About four dozen cray fish will be
  enough, pick and stew them in the soup, after it has been strained, till done; add a little
  cayenne, and the spawn of a lobster pounded, and stirred in to thicken as well as flavour the
  soup. <i>Prawns</i>, <i>cockles</i>, and <i>muscles</i>, in the same way. It may be made of meat
  stock, and flavoured to be richer.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eel Soup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">To 3 lbs. of eels, cut in pieces, allow three quarts of water; after this has
  boiled and been scummed, add two rather large crusts of toasted bread, eight blades of mace, three
  onions, a few whole peppercorns, and a faggot of herbs. Let this boil gently till half wasted, and
  then serve it with dice of toasted bread. You may add  pint of cream, with a dessert-spoonful of
  flour, rubbed smooth in it. (<i>For fish forcemeats see in the Index.</i>)</p>

  <p class="sp3 ac"><i>To Boil.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">The</span> fish-kettle ought to be roomy: the water should, according to some,
  be cold, and spring water, and be slow in coming to a boil. I incline to this: according to
  others, it ought to be hot at the time of putting in the fish, upon the supposition that the
  shorter time it is in water the better. Experience must, however, be the best instructor; and much
  depends on the size, and sort of the fish. A handful of salt in the water, helps to draw the slime
  from the fish, and gives it firmness. Vinegar is used for the latter purpose, particularly for cod
  and turbot.&mdash;When the water boils, take off the scum, and place the fish-kettle by the side
  of the fire, to simmer gently; the usual allowance of time is twelve minutes to the pound, but
  there is no certain rule. Run a sharp knife into the thick part, and if it divide easily from the
  bone, it is done. When you think the fish done, lift up the strainer, and place it across the
  kettle to drain, and if it have to wait, put a heated cover on it, and over that, several folds of
  flannel; this is the best substitute for a <i>Bain Marie</i>. It must not stay an instant in
  water, after it is done. Serve on a fish drainer, which, as well as the dish, ought to be quite
  hot, for half cold fish is very bad. Crisp parsley, slices of lemon and barberries, also picked
  red cabbage, are used to garnish.</p>

  <p>Some cooks say that <i>salt fish</i> should scarcely <i>boil</i> at all, but remain till
  tender, in hot water, just coming to a boil; put it on in cold water, and let it be a long time
  heating through.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Stock for gravy, for stewing, or sauce, is made of meat or fish, according to
  whether it be to be maigre or not. Any white fish, and the trimmings of all quite fresh fish, may
  be used. These may be browned first, in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page115">{115}</span>frying-pan, then put into 1 or 2 quarts of water, according to the
  quantity you require, with a bunch of sweet herbs, onion, eschalot, mace, and lemon peel; boil it
  and scum well; then strain it, and put in the fish to stew. Fish stock is best made on the morning
  it is wanted. <i>Court Bouillon</i>, for boiling or stewing fish, is as follows: to a gallon of
  water, a handful of salt, 2 onions, 2 carrots, and eschalots, a bunch of parsley, thyme, and
  basil, 2 bay leaves, 12 peppercorns, and 6 cloves, also a large piece of butter. Stew, then strain
  it. This may be enriched as required. It keeps well, and is a good basis for stock.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This is rather difficult, and requires exceeding care and attention. Some people
  consider that lard is essential, but clarified dripping is as good. Oil is used in countries where
  the olive tree grows. Wash, and lay the fish in the folds of a clean cloth, for it must be quite
  dry. Flour it lightly, if to be covered with bread-crumbs, for if not quite dry, the bread will
  not adhere to it. The crumbs of stale bread; or to be very delicate in appearance, use biscuit
  powder. Having floured the fish, brush over with yolk and white of egg, then strew over the crumbs
  or powder, so as to cover every part of the fish. The frying-pan of an oval shape. The fire hot,
  but not fierce. If not hot enough, the fish will be soddened, if too hot, it will catch and burn.
  There should be fat enough to cover the fish; let it boil, (for frying is, in fact, <i>boiling in
  fat</i>,) skim it with an egg slice, as it becomes hot, then dip the tail of the fish in to
  ascertain the heat; if it become crisp at once the pan is ready, then lay in the fish. When done,
  lay it before the fire to dry, either on whity brown paper or a soft cloth; turn it two or three
  times, and if the frying fat has not been sufficiently hot, this will, in some measure, remedy the
  defect.&mdash;Fat in which veal or lamb has been fried may be used for fish, when it has settled
  long enough to be poured from the sediment.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Turbot to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">First wash well, and soak it in salt and water; when quite clean, score the skin of
  the back, or the belly will crack <span class="pagenum" id="page116">{116}</span>when the fish
  begins to swell. Do not take off the fins, as they are a delicacy. Place it on a fish-strainer, in
  a roomy turbot-kettle, the back downwards. You may rub it over with lemon juice, to keep it white.
  Cover the fish with cold water, and throw in salt. Allow 1 lb. salt to a gallon and a half of
  water. It should be quite half an hour in coming to a boil, scum well, then draw the kettle to the
  side, and if a fish of 10 lbs. weight (larger are not so good), let it simmer 30 minutes, but if
  it do not simmer <i>gently</i> the fish will be spoiled and the skin cracked. When done, garnish
  with slices of lemon, scraped horse-radish, parsley, barberries, whole capers, or the pea of a
  lobster, forced through a sieve. A very few smelts or sprats fried, laid round the turbot. Lobster
  sauce is most esteemed, but shrimp or anchovy sauce answer very well. (<i>See to dress Cold
  Turbot.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Brill.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as turbot, except that you put it into boiling water, the flesh being
  softer. <i>Or</i>: parboiled, covered with egg and crumbs, and browned before the fire, or in the
  frying-pan. If 6 lbs. simmer it  an hour, but when it begins to crack it is done.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>John Dory.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as brill.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sole to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash clean, cover it with cold water, put in a handful of salt, and let it come
  gently to a boil, take off the scum, and set the fish-kettle aside; let it simmer very gently five
  minutes, and it is done, unless very large, then eight or ten minutes. Oyster sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cod to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash clean, and rub the inside with salt; cover it with water, in the kettle. A
  small fish will be done in fifteen minutes after the water boils; a large one will take half an
  hour; but the tail being much thinner than the thick part, it will be done too much if boiled all
  at once; <span class="pagenum" id="page117">{117}</span>therefore, the best way is to cut the tail
  in slices, to fry, and garnish the head and shoulders, or serve separately. Lay the roe on one
  side, the liver on the other side of the fish. Serve oyster, shrimp sauce, or plain melted butter;
  also scalloped oysters.&mdash;Garnish with lemon, and horse-radish. If the fish be in
  <i>slices</i>, the water should be made to boil as soon as possible after they are in it, and 10
  minutes will cook them: pour shrimp or anchovy sauce over the slices. If you wish it to be rich,
  having some clear broth, put in a boned anchovy, some pickled oysters, chopped fine, pepper, salt,
  a glass of Port wine, and a thickening of butter and flour; boil this up, skim it, and pour over
  the slices of cod.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cod to Boil Crimp.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put it into boiling hot salt and water, draw it to the side, and let it simmer 15
  or 20 minutes, according to its size. Slices less. Oyster sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salt Cod and Ling.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak it, according to the time it has been salted. If hard and dry, two nights,
  changing the water two or three times. The best <i>Dogger Bank</i> split fish require less. Let
  there be plenty of water, and the fish a long time in becoming heated through. Then simmer <i>very
  gently</i>, or it will be tough. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, in quarters. Serve egg sauce,
  parsnips, or beet-root.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cod to Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut in thick slices; flour or egg, and cover with bread-crumbs or biscuit powder.
  Fry in hot dripping or lard.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cod's Head and Shoulders.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash clean, then quickly dash boiling water over it, which will cause the slime to
  ooze out; this should be carefully removed with a knife, but take care not to break the skin; wipe
  the head clean, and lay it on a strainer, in a turbot-kettle of boiling water; put in salt and a
  tea-cupful of vinegar. Take care that it is quite covered. Simmer <span class="pagenum"
  id="page118">{118}</span>from thirty to forty minutes. Drain, and put it into a rather deep dish;
  glaze it with beaten yolk of egg, strew bread-crumbs, pepper, salt, and lemon-peel over, stick in
  bits of butter, and brown it before the fire; baste with butter, constantly strewing more
  bread-crumbs and chopped parsley over.&mdash;A rich sauce for this is made as follows; have a
  quart of beef or veal stock; or, if to be maigre, a rich well-seasoned fish stock; thicken with
  flour rubbed in butter, and strain it; add 50 oysters, picked and bearded, or the hard meat of a
  boiled lobster cut up, and the soft part pounded, 2 glasses of sherry, and the juice of a lemon.
  Boil it altogether, five minutes, skim and pour part into the dish where the fish is: the rest
  serve in a sauce tureen. It may be garnished with fried smelts, flounders, or oysters. The French
  stuff it with meat or fish forcemeat, with some balls of the same fried, as a
  garnish.&mdash;<i>Cold cod</i> may be dressed as cold turbot. The head may be baked; bits of
  butter stuck all over it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cod Sounds.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scald, clean, and rub them with salt; take off the outer coat, and parboil, then
  flour and broil them. Pour over a thickened gravy, which has a tea-spoonful of made mustard,
  cayenne, and what other seasoning you like.&mdash;<i>Or,</i> fried, and served with the same kind
  of sauce.&mdash;<i>Or</i>, dressed in <i>ragout</i>, parboiled, cut in pieces, and stewed in good
  gravy, or in white sauce. Serve mustard and lemon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cabeached Cod.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil vinegar enough to cover the pieces of fish, a little mace, a few peppercorns,
  a few cloves, and a little salt; when this is cold put a tea-cupful of olive oil. Cut the tail
  part of a cod fish in slices, rub pepper and salt on each, fry them in oil, then lay them on a
  plate to cool; when cold, put them into a pan or jar, and pour the pickle over. If you like, lay
  thin slices of onion between the fish. <i>Salmon</i> is good in this way. Serve salad with
  this.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cod to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Lay three slices of cod in a stewpan, with  pint of weak <span class="pagenum"
  id="page119">{119}</span>white wine, <i>not</i> sweet, 6 oz. butter, two dozen oysters and their
  liquor, three blades of mace, salt, pepper, and a few crumbs of bread; stew this gently, and
  thicken with flour before you serve it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon to Boil</i>,</p>

  <p class="sp3">Should be well cleaned and scaled (the less washing the better), and cut open as
  little as possible. Let there be water enough to well cover the fish, and salt in the proportion
  of 1 lb. to a gallon and a half. When it begins to boil, scum well, and put the fish in; for most
  cooks, I believe, are of opinion that salmon eats <i>firmer</i> when put on in hot or boiling
  water. A fish of 10 lbs. will take a full hour, or a little more, but it must only simmer all the
  time. Let the drainer be hot, put a folded napkin on it, and serve the fish directly. Garnish with
  curled parsley, horseradish, or slices of lemon. Serve shrimp, anchovy, or lobster sauce, also
  plain melted butter. Cucumber, and also salad, are eaten with salmon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To boil Crimp.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off the head, with about two inches of the neck, and clean the fish, opening it
  as little as possible, and do not cut it up the breast; also cut off the tail. Then cut the fish
  in circular slices, wash them, and lay them in salt and water. Put the head and tail on the
  strainer of the kettle, and pour in boiling water, with a little salt, and a very little vinegar;
  boil it five minutes, then put in the slices, and boil fifteen minutes, scumming all the time. Put
  the head and tail in the middle of the dish, the slices round. Sauces the same as the
  last.&mdash;Mustard is good with salmon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon to Grill.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Split the salmon, and endeavour not to mangle it in taking out the bone. Cut it
  into fillets four inches in breadth. Dry, but do not beat or press them, in the folds of a linen
  cloth, or dust them with flour to dry them. Have a clear fire, as for steaks, rub the gridiron
  with chalk, lay on the slices, and turn them occasionally. Serve very hot, with anchovy or shrimp
  sauce. French cooks steep the <span class="pagenum" id="page120">{120}</span>slices in oil, cover
  them with seasonings and fine herbs, and broil them, basting the while with oil. Caper sauce with
  this. Salmon may be thus prepared, then <i>fried</i>.&mdash;Some put the slices in paper to
  broil.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon, Trout, Haddock, or Gurnet to bake.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix a seasoning of salt, pepper, and allspice, and rub a little in the fish. If a
  small salmon, turn the tail round to the mouth, and run a skewer through the fish to keep it in
  form. Place it on a stand, in a deep dish, cover with bits of butter, and strew the remainder of
  the seasoning over. Put it in the oven (an American or Dutch oven, before the fire, is very good
  for this), and baste occasionally with the liquor which runs from it. Garnish and serve the same
  sauce as boiled salmon. <i>Slices</i> of salmon may be baked this way.&mdash;Or: make it richer as
  follows: boil in a quart of vinegar, a piece of butter, 2 onions, the same of eschalot and
  carrots, a bunch of parsley, a sprig of thyme, a bay leaf, some basil, cloves, and allspice.
  Having cleaned and scaled the fish, fill it with fish forcemeat, sew it up, turn the tail into the
  mouth and skewer it. Place it on a stand in a baking dish, and pour the liquor over. Baste it from
  time to time. When the fish is done, pour off the liquor, and boil it up with an anchovy, cayenne,
  lemon juice, and a little thickening of butter rolled in flour. Place the fish in a rather deep
  dish, and strain the liquor round it. A <i>salmon peel</i> is best suited to this, being less rich
  than large salmon. (<i>See Haddock to stew.</i>)</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon to Pickle.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the fish in pieces, not very small, and boil them in a little water and salt,
  scumming carefully all the time. When done, lift the fish out into a pan, and boil the liquor up
  with vinegar and spices to your taste, with black pepper, mace and ginger. Pour it cold over the
  fish.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: into the best vinegar, put 1 pint of white wine (supposing there to be 2
  quarts of liquor or water to 1 of vinegar), add mace, ginger, horse-radish, cloves, allspice, a
  bay leaf, a sprig of lemon thyme, salt, and pepper. Pour it cold over the fish. Put away
  carefully, in a vegetable dish, any salmon left at table, strew over it  a salt-spoonful of
  cayenne; boil 12 <span class="pagenum" id="page121">{121}</span>allspice in a pint of white wine
  vinegar, and pour it scalding hot over the salmon. Keep it in a cool place.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon to Dry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the fish down, take out the roe, and rub the whole with common salt; let it
  hang twenty-four hours to drain. Pound 3 oz. saltpetre, 2 oz. bay salt, and 2 oz. coarse sugar;
  rub these into the salmon, and lay it on a large dish for two days; then rub with common salt, and
  in twenty-four hours it will be fit to dry. Drain it, wipe it dry, stretch it open and fasten it
  with pieces of stick, in order that it may dry equally; hang it in a chimney corner where wood or
  peat is burnt, and it will be smoked in five days. Broil slices for breakfast. If too much smoked,
  or too dry, soak the slices in lukewarm water, before you broil them. To make this more relishing,
  dip the slices in oil, then in a seasoning of herbs and spices, and broil them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon to Collar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Clean, scale, and bone the fish, then season it highly with mace, cloves, pepper
  and salt, roll it up into a handsome collar, and bandage it; then bake it with vinegar and butter,
  or simmer in vinegar and water. Serve melted butter, and anchovy sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salmon to Pot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Do not wash, but clean with a cloth, and scale the fish, rub with salt, and let it
  lie three hours; then drain, and cut it into pieces. Sprinkle over them a seasoning of mace, black
  and Jamaica pepper, pounded, and lay them in a dish; cover them with melted butter, and set the
  dish in the oven. When done, drain the fat from the fish, and lay the pieces into little pots;
  when cold, cover with clarified butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sturgeon</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Is generally roasted or baked, if the former, tie a piece of 3 or 4 lbs. on a lark
  spit, and fasten that to a large one, baste with butter, and serve with a rich meat or maigre
  gravy highly flavoured. Serve besides, or instead of gravy, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page122">{122}</span>oyster, lobster, or anchovy sauce. <i>Slices</i> of sturgeon may be
  egged, rolled in bread-crumbs, seasonings, and herbs, then broiled in buttered papers. Also it is
  <i>stewed</i> in good beef gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Skate.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This should be broad, thick, and of a bluish cream colour. It must be quite fresh,
  if to be crimp, and put on in hot water. It will keep, in cold weather, two or three days, but
  will eat tender. Shrimp, lobster, or caper sauce, parsley and butter, or onion
  sauce.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put into a stew-pan  pint of water,  pint of vinegar, all the trimmings
  of the skate, two onions, a clove of garlic, some parsley, and a little basil. Boil till the
  trimmings are cooked to a mash, then strain and put the skate into the liquor; it should just come
  to a boil, and stand by the side of the fire ten minutes. Garnish with the liver. Serve caper
  sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Skate to Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Parboil it first, then cut in thin slices, and dip them in egg and bread-crumbs.
  Then either fried or broiled. Both ways skate is good <i>cold,</i> with mustard, pepper, oil and
  vinegar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Thornback and Maids.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Haddock to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The night before, fill the eyes with salt, and hang the fish up. <i>Or</i>, for a

  <p class="ac"><i>Haddocks to Stew, Bake, or Roast.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If you have six small ones, take the heads, tails and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page123">{123}</span>trimmings of all, and one whole fish, boil these in a quart of water or
  broth, with an onion, sweet herbs, and cayenne; boil well, and thicken with brown flour; add
  spices, and mushroom catsup, or essence of anchovy; strain this, boil again, and skim well; then
  lay in the rest of your haddocks, cut in pieces. If there require more sauce, add as much as is
  necessary, of any broth or gravy you have; some oysters, or oyster-pickle. When done, take the
  fish out with a slice, lay it in a dish, and pour the sauce, which ought to be thick, round. This
  fish may be stuffed with meat, or rich forcemeat, and dressed whole in the above
  gravy.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: the fish being well cleaned, dry it, and put in the stuffing directed
  for fillet of veal; tie the tail to the mouth, put the haddock in a pie-dish, rub it over with
  flour, half fill the dish with veal stock, and bake it in a slow oven 40 minutes. A glass of white
  wine, or half a one of brandy, oyster-pickle, or lemon juice, either of these may be used,
  according to taste. <i>Gurnet</i> the same. <i>To Roast</i>: Stuff a good-sized one with veal
  stuffing, and dangle it before the fire; baste with butter, and when nearly done, take the gravy
  out of the pan, skim off the fat, then boil up the gravy with pepper, salt, and a wine-glassful of
  Port wine.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Haddocks to Bake, quite plain.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil and mash some potatoes. Season the fish, and put a piece of butter inside, lay
  it in the middle of the dish, and put a thick border of the potatoes round. Brush over the whole
  with egg, stick bits of butter over the fish, and bake for half an hour; when in the oven a short
  time, pour a little melted butter and catsup in the dish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Haddock or Mackerel to Broil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Split the fish, bone the haddock, salt it, and hang it for two days in the chimney
  corner.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Haddocks, Soles, Flounders, Plaice, Perch, Tench, Trout, Whitings, and Herrings
  to Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Haddocks, soles, and generally whitings, are skinned. Plaice wiped, not washed, and
  must lie three or four hours <span class="pagenum" id="page124">{124}</span>after being rubbed
  with salt. When the fish is cleaned and wiped dry, dust with flour, and lay it gently into the
  boiling fat; having first egged and dipped it into bread-crumbs. The fat may be either lard,
  butter, dripping, or oil. Turn it carefully, lift it out when done, and lay it on a sheet of paper
  in a sieve, whilst you fry the rest; or put it before the fire, if it require drying. Garnish with
  curled parsley, and slices of lemon. Serve very hot. Shrimp or anchovy sauce, and plain butter.
  <i>Whitings</i> and <i>haddocks</i> should have the tail skewered into the mouth.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mackerel and Herrings to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The fresher these are eaten the better. They require a great deal of cleaning.
  Choose soft roes to boil. A small mackerel will be done in a quarter of an hour. When the eye
  starts it is done, and should not stand in the water. Serve fennel boiled and chopped, in melted
  butter, and garnish with lumps of chopped fennel. Both these may be broiled, whole or split, and
  sprinkled during the cooking with chopped herbs and seasonings.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mackerel and Herrings to Bake.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose fine ones, in season, cut off the heads and take out the roes. Pound
  together some mace, nutmeg, Jamaica pepper, cloves, and salt; put a little of this into each fish,
  then put a layer of them into a pan, and a layer of the mixture upon them, then another layer of
  fish, and so on. Fill the vessel with vinegar, and tie over close with brown paper. Bake them 6 or
  8 hours. To be eaten cold.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mackerel and Herrings to Pickle.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as salmon.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: as follows: get them as fresh as possible.
  Take off the heads, split the fish open, and lay them in salt and water an hour; prepare the
  following pickle: for 1 dozen mackerel, take 1 lb. common and 1 lb. bay salt, 1 oz. saltpetre, 1
  oz. lump sugar broken, and mix well together. Take the fish out of the water, drain and wipe them.
  Sprinkle a little salt over them, put a layer into a jar or cask (the skin side downwards), then a
  layer of <span class="pagenum" id="page125">{125}</span>the mixture, till the vessel is full.
  Press it down, and cover close. Ready in three months.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Herrings and Sardinias to Broil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Open and trim them, skin them or not, as you like. If hard, soak in lukewarm water.
  Broil them, either over or before the fire, and rub butter over as they broil.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Carp, Perch, and Tench to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If very large, divide the fish. Rub the inside with salt and mixed spices, stick in
  a few cloves, and a blade or two of mace, in pieces, lay them in a stew-pan, and cover with good
  fish, or meat stock. Put in 2 onions, an anchovy chopped, cayenne, 3 glasses of claret, or 2 of
  Port. When done, take the fish up, and keep it hot, while you thicken the gravy with butter and
  browned flour; add mushroom catsup, oyster-pickle, chili vinegar, or the juice of a lemon; simmer
  the sauce, skim and pour it over the fish. The roe may be kept back and fried, to garnish the
  fish, with sippets of bread fried. Use horse-radish and slices of lemon also, to garnish. Where
  meat gravy is not used, more wine is required.&mdash;<i>Cod's skull, Soles, Eels, Flounders,
  Trout, Whitings and fillets of Turbot, Cod and Halibut</i>, may be dressed the same way.
  <i>Or</i>: having parboiled the fish, brown it in the frying-pan, and stew it in good gravy
  seasoned with sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, basil, onions, pepper, salt, and spices: when nearly
  done, thicken the sauce, and flavour it, with a small portion each, of Worcester, Harvey's and
  Reading sauces, soy, anchovy sauce, oyster-pickle, catsup, and an equal portion of Port and white
  wine. The carp's blood should not be omitted.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Carp and Pike (or Jack) to Boil or Bake.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If to be maigre, make a forcemeat of the yolks of 3 eggs, some oysters bearded, 3
  anchovies, an onion and some parsley, all chopped; mace, black pepper, allspice, and salt,
  pounded; mix this with biscuit flour, or crumbs of bread, and the fish being well cleaned and
  scaled, fill it with the stuffing, and sew it up. If to bake, lay it in a deep dish, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page126">{126}</span>stick butter over, and baste plentifully, as it bakes, in
  a moderate oven. Serve anchovy sauce. <i>Or</i>: you may take the fish out, and keep it hot,
  whilst you make a rich sauce thus: thicken the gravy in the dish, and boil it up with parsley and
  sweet herbs; then strain it, add made mustard, a glass of Port wine, and one of chili or any other
  flavouring vinegar, also pounded mace, salt, and cayenne. Pour this over the fish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eels to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Skin and cut them in pieces. They may be egged and rolled in bread-crumbs, or
  merely floured. If to be maigre, stew them in fish stock; if otherwise, in good clear beef gravy,
  in which seasoning herbs, and roots have been boiled. Stew the fish gently, until done, then take
  them out, keep them hot, and thicken the gravy with browned flour, or what you like; add a glass
  of white wine, and one of mushroom catsup, also a spoonful of made mustard; boil it up, strain and
  pour it over the fish. Garnish with scraped horse-radish, and barberries. <i>Whiting</i>, also
  <i>slices of Turbot</i>, in the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lampreys to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage which runs down the back,
  and season well with cloves, mace, nutmeg, allspice, a tea-spoonful of mushroom powder, a little
  black pepper and cayenne; put it into a stew-pan with good gravy to cover it, and sherry or
  Madeira; keep the pan covered till the fish is tender, then take it out, and keep it hot while you
  boil up the liquor with essence of anchovy, lemon pickle, Gloucester sauce, and thickening; add
  the juice of a lemon, a spoonful of made mustard, 1 of soy, and 1 of chili vinegar. Fry the spawn
  to put round the fish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eels to Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">They should always be <i>gently parboiled</i>, before they are either fried or
  broiled, then allowed to be cold, before they are cut up; but if very small, turn the tail round
  to the mouth, and fry it whole. Rub with a mixture of spices, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page127">{127}</span>brush with egg, and cover them with bread-crumbs. Fry of a light brown,
  and lay them on a sieve to drain.&mdash;Small eels are sometimes boiled, and served with dried
  sage and parsley strewed over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eels to Collar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose a large eel. Slit open the belly and take out the bone. Rub it well with a
  mixture of pepper, salt, parsley, sage, thyme, and lemon peel. Roll up, quite tight, and bind it
  with tape; then boil it gently, in salt, a little vinegar, and water to cover it, till tender. It
  will keep in the pickle it was boiled in.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eels to Spitchcock.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">They are not skinned, but well cleaned, and rubbed with salt. Take out the bone,
  wash and dry them in a cloth. Either cut in pieces, or roll them round and cook them whole. First
  (parboiled) dip the fish into a thick batter of eggs, chopped parsley, sage, eschalot, lemon peel,
  pepper and salt; then roll them in bread-crumbs or biscuit powder, dip again in batter, and again
  in the crumbs. Broil over a clear fire. Garnish with curled parsley or slices of lemon, and serve
  anchovy sauce, or butter flavoured with cucumber vinegar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Trout to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The fish being cleaned, put it into a stew-pan, with half champagne and half
  rhenish, or half moselle and half sherry, in all a tumbler full; season with pepper, salt, an
  onion with 3 cloves in it, and a very little parsley and thyme, also a crust of bread. When the
  fish is done, lift it out whilst you thicken the sauce; bruise the bread, but if that be not
  enough, add a little flour rubbed smooth, and a bit of butter, boil it up and pour over the trout
  in the dish. Garnish with sliced lemon and fried bread.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sprats, Smelts, and Gudgeon to Bake, Boil, or Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Mullet.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The inside is not taken out. Wash the outside of the fish, fold it in oiled paper,
  lay in a rather shallow dish, and bake it gently. Make a sauce of the liquor, a piece of butter
  rolled in flour, a little anchovy essence, and a glass of sherry. Boil it up, and serve in a
  tureen. Send the fish to table in the paper.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Water Souchy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Eels, whitings, soles, flounders, and mackerel</i> are generally used. Stew it

  <p class="ac"><i>Lobsters and Crabs to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Have plenty of water, make it quite salt, brush the lobster or crab, and put it in.
  From forty to fifty minutes <span class="pagenum" id="page129">{129}</span>for the middling size,
  more if very large, less if very small. They will throw up a great deal of scum, which must be
  taken off. Wipe the lobster with a damp cloth, rub a piece of butter over, then wipe it with a dry
  cloth. Take off the large claws, and crack them; split down the tail, and place the whole neatly
  in a dish. A very nice sauce, as follows: boil hard 2 eggs, pound the yolk in a mortar, with a
  little vinegar, and the spawn of the lobster, make it quite smooth, add a large spoonful of salad
  oil, 3 spoonsful of good vinegar, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, and a little cayenne and

  water to moisten the meat, and a good-sized piece of butter rolled in flour, a little cream, and
  some catsup. Serve on toasted sippets; or have the shell of a lobster or crab cleaned, and serve
  the meat in it.&mdash;<i>Another way</i> is, not to warm the mince <i>over</i> the fire, but to
  put it into the shell, and set that before the fire in a Dutch oven, strew some fine bread-crumbs
  or biscuit powder over all, and stick some bits of butter over that; brown with a salamander, and
  serve quite hot. <i>Prawns</i> the same way.&mdash;Lobster is sometimes fricasseed, in rich veal
  gravy; or with cream, and yolk of egg. Garnish with pickled cucumber, or other
  pickle.&mdash;Lobster may be cooked as follows: chop the meat of a large one, and mix with it a
  very little lemon peel, pepper, salt, nutmeg, butter, cream, and crumbs of stale bread; roll this
  well, and divide it into small quantities; put each one into light puff paste, the size of
  sausages, rub them over with yolk of egg, then with bread-crumbs; fry of a yellow brown, and serve
  with crisped parsley.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: wash and clean some spinach and put it into a saucepan,
  with the meat of a lobster, or a pint of picked shrimps cut small, an onion, a clove of garlic

  all is in, press it down, pour melted butter over, and put it half an hour in a slow oven. Let it
  then get cold, take off the butter, take out the meat and pack it into small pots; clarify the
  butter, and pour over. The butter left may turn to account in sauces, as it will be highly
  flavoured. If for sandwiches, the meat must be pounded in a mortar before it is baked, that it may
  spread more easily.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Prawns, Shrimps, and Cray Fish to Pot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil them in salt and water, pick them carefully, then pound in a mortar, with, to

  nutmeg and grated tongue, hung beef, or ham. Boil it well, strain, and let it get cold. Take off
  the fat, pour the jelly from the sediment, and boil it up with 2 glasses of white wine, and the
  whites of 4 eggs whisked to a froth. Do not stir this as it boils. When done, let it stand a
  quarter of an hour to settle; then pass it through a jelly bag: pour some of it into a mould, or
  deep dish, to become firm; then stick in the fish, neatly picked, in any form you like, and fill
  up the dish with jelly. When quite cold, turn it out.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fish Cake.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pick the fish from the bones, add 1 lb. of mashed <span class="pagenum"

  peel; flavour either with essence of anchovy, of lobster, of shrimp, or of oyster, according to
  taste and the sort of fish; add Harvey's or Camp or Gloucester sauce, also lemon pickle and
  eschalot vinegar, to your taste: mix the whole with a little melted butter and an egg, dip in

  <p class="ac"><i>Fish to Pull.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">When cold, pick the fish clean from the bones, and to 1 lb. add two table-spoonsful
  of anchovy, two of lemon pickle, one of Harvey's, one of Camp sauce, one of chili vinegar, a
  little cayenne, white pepper, and mace; when nearly hot, add a piece of butter rolled in flour to
  thicken it, then make it quite hot, put it in a dish, grate bread-crumbs over, and baste with
  melted butter, to moisten them, then brown with a salamander, or in a Dutch oven, or on a tin
  before the fire, with a Scotch bonnet behind it.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: Pick from the bones, in flakes,
  any cold or boiled fish, salmon, cod, turbot, sole, skate or pike; and to 1 lb. fish, add  pint

  <p class="ac"><i>Oysters to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose plump natives, beard and stew two dozen in their own liquor, till just
  coming to a boil; take them out and lay them in a dish, whilst you strain the liquor into a
  saucepan; add a little piece of butter rubbed in flour, a blade of mace, a few peppercorns, lemon
  peel, three table-spoonsful of cream, and a little cayenne. Lay the oysters in, cover the
  saucepan, and let them simmer five minutes, very gently. Have toasted sippets in a deep dish, take
  out the oysters when done with a silver spoon, lay them in and pour the gravy over.&mdash;The
  French strew grated parmesan over the oysters, before the sauce. <i>Oysters to
  Grill.</i>&mdash;Toss them in a stew-pan in a little of their own liquor, a piece of butter, and a
  little chopped parsley, but do not let them boil. Clean their own shells, lay an oyster in each,
  and some little bits of butter. Put the shells on the gridiron, in two minutes they will be done.
  <i>Oysters to Brown.</i>&mdash;Open carefully, lift them out of their liquor, and dip each one in
  yolk of egg, beaten up with flour, pepper and salt, then brown them in a frying-pan, with a piece
  of butter; take them out, pour the liquor into the pan, thicken with a piece of butter rolled in
  flour, add a little catsup, minced lemon peel, and parsley, let it boil up, put in the oysters,
  and stir them in it a few minutes. Serve on toasted sippets. <i>Oysters to Fry.</i>&mdash;Make a
  batter of three or four eggs, a table-spoonful of flour, a tea-spoonful of salt, and the  of one
  of cayenne, also a very little mace. Cover the oysters well with this, and fry in boiling lard of
  a light brown; then grate toasted or brown bread over them, and put before the fire for three
  minutes in a Dutch oven. <i>Oysters or Cockles to Scallop.</i>&mdash;Stew the oysters in their own

  the oyster liquor, and put some little bits of butter, then a layer of oysters, then of crumbs,
  till the shell is full; a light sprinkling of salt, pepper, and cayenne; let bread-crumbs be at
  the top, and lay on some little bits of butter. Brown before the fire in a Dutch oven. <i>Cold
  fish</i> may be re-cooked in this way for supper or luncheon. <i>Oysters in Dean Swift's
  way.</i>&mdash;Wash the shells <span class="pagenum" id="page133">{133}</span>clean, and put the
  oysters, unopened, into an earthen pot, with their hollow sides downwards; set the pot, covered,
  in a kettle of water, and make that boil. Do not let the water get into the shells; three or four
  minutes will cook the oysters.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Oysters to Keep.</i></p>

  <p>Wash them clean, lay them, bottom downwards, into a tub, and cover them with strong salt and

  <h1 class="ac" title="XIV. Made Dishes" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER XIV.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">MADE DISHES.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">What</span> is generally understood in England to represent a "made dish" is
  something too rich, or too highly seasoned, to be available for a family dinner; but this is an
  error. Made dishes are not of necessity rich or costly, but judgment is required in compounding
  them, and, by a little practice, a cook will acquire this judgment, and then will be able to
  convert the remains of joints, and much that would not appear to advantage if plainly cooked, into
  nice palatable dishes. It is the proper application of seasonings and flavouring ingredients, and
  not the superabundance of them, which constitutes the excellence of "made dishes."&mdash;(<i>See
  in the Index for Sauces.</i>)</p>

  <p>It has been directed, in making soup, that it must not boil fast. Made dishes should never boil
  at all; <i>very</i> gentle simmering, and the lid of the stewpan must not be removed, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page134">{134}</span>after the necessary scumming is over. Time should be
  allowed for gradual cooking, and that over, the stewpan ought to stand by the fire a few minutes,
  that the fat risen to the top be taken off, before the dish is served. Indeed, ragouts are better
  made the day before, because then the fat is more completely taken off. Shake the stewpan if there
  be danger of burning, but if the lid be removed, the savoury steams escape, and also much of the
  succulent qualities of the meat.</p>

  <p>Great delicacy is required in re-warming made dishes; they should be merely heated through; and
  the safest mode is to place the stewpan in a vessel of boiling water.</p>

  <p>All made dishes require gravy, more or less good, and, in most houses, this, by a little
  previous forethought, may always be ready; for if the liquor in which meat has been boiled be
  saved, that seasoned, flavoured, and thickened, the cook will always be provided with gravy for a
  ragout or fricassee. (<i>See the Chapter on Soup, and also that on Gravy.</i>)</p>

  <p>The following is a good store gravy.&mdash;Boil a ham, or part of one, in water to cover it,
  with four onions, a clove of garlic, six eschalots, a bay leaf, a bunch of sweet herbs, six
  cloves, and a few peppercorns. Keep the pot covered, and let it simmer three hours. The liquor is
  strained, and kept till poultry or meat of any kind is boiled; put the two together, and boil down
  fast till reduced to three pints; when cold, it will be a jelly, and suits any sort of ragout or
  hash.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Every cook ought to learn the art of <i>larding</i>, and also of <i>braising</i>,
  as they are both used in made dishes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Lard.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Have larding pins of various sizes. Cut strips of bacon, with a sharp knife, put
  one into the pin, pierce the skin and a very little of the flesh, and draw it through; the rows
  may be either near together or far apart. The bacon is sometimes rolled in seasonings to suit the
  meat.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Blanch, either Meat or Vegetables.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This gives plumpness as well as whiteness. Put whatever it be into a saucepan with
  cold water to cover, and let <span class="pagenum" id="page135">{135}</span>it come to a boil;
  take it out, plunge it into cold water, and let it remain till cold.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Braise.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This is, in fact, to stew in highly seasoned fat. Poultry must be trussed as for
  boiling. Either lard, or stuff it, with good forcemeat, and provide a thick-bottomed stew-pan,
  large enough to hold it. Line this with slices of bacon, or fat beef, sliced onion, carrot, and
  turnip. Strew in a few chopped herbs, salt, mace, black and Jamaica pepper, 2 bay leaves, and a
  clove of garlic. (The seasoning to suit the meat.) Lay the meat in, and cover it, first with the
  same quantity of herbs and spices as above, then with thin slices of bacon, and, over all, white
  paper; wrap a cloth about the lid of the stew-pan, and press it down, setting a weight on the top.
  Place the stew-pan over a slow fire, and put embers on the lid. The cooking process should be very
  slow. Braised joints are generally glazed.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Glaze.</i></p>

  <p>When the meat is sufficiently cooked, take it out of the stew-pan and keep it covered. Strain
  the gravy into a clean stew-pan, put it on the fire, and let it boil quickly, uncovered, a few
  minutes; brush the meat over with this, let it cool, and then brush again. What is not used may be
  kept in a jar tied down, in a cool place.&mdash;<i>Fowls</i>, <i>Hams</i>, and <i>Tongues</i>,
  cooked by plain boiling, are often glazed, to be eaten cold.&mdash;<i>Another way</i> is, to
  prepare a glaze beforehand, for <i>Hams</i>, <i>Tongues</i>, or <i>Fricandeaux</i>, thus: break
  the bone of a knuckle of veal, cut the meat in pieces, the same with shin of beef, add any poultry
  or game trimmings, and a few slices of bacon; put them in a stew-pan over a quick fire, and let
  them <i>catch</i>, then put in a little broth of cow-heels, or calf's-head, or feet. Let this stew
  to a strong jelly; then strain, and put it by in jars. It may be flavoured to suit the dish, at
  the time it is heated to be used. Glaze should be heated in a vessel of boiling water, and when
  quite hot, brushed over the meat. When <i>cream</i> is used, it should be first heated (not boil),
  poured in by degrees, and stirred, to prevent curdling. In making a stew, remember to let it stand
  by the fire nearly ten minutes, not simmering, that <span class="pagenum"
  id="page136">{136}</span>you may remove the fat, before you put in the thickening. The
  <i>flour</i> for this should be of the finest kind, well dried. For <i>Ragouts</i>, you may brown
  it, before the fire, or in the oven, and keep it ready prepared. It is convenient to keep spices
  ready pounded; the quantity so prepared, as to be proportioned to the usual consumption.
  <i>Kitchen pepper</i> is: 1 oz. ginger,  oz. each, of nutmeg, black and Jamaica pepper, and
  cinnamon; pound or grind, and keep them in small phials, corked, and labelled. For <i>white
  sauces</i>, white pepper, nutmeg, mace, and grated lemon peel, in equal proportion, may also be
  kept prepared; cayenne, added or not, as taste requires; cayenne is used in preparations of
  brains, kidneys, or liver. Made dishes are sometimes served on a <i>Pure</i> of mushrooms or
  vegetables. This is: boiled to a mash, just thicker than a sauce, and much used in French cookery.
  To <i>Marinade</i> is to <i>steep</i> meat or fish, in a mixture of wine, vinegar, herbs and
  spices.</p>

  <p><i>Onions</i>, small silver ones, are blanched, peeled and boiled in good broth to serve as
  garnish to <i>bouilli</i> and many other made dishes; or not blanched, but stewed with butter, if
  to be brown. When very strong you may parboil them with a turnip, for a stew, or forcemeat.</p>

  <p>Some persons use <i>brandy</i> in made dishes. <i>Wine</i> in the proportion of a wine-glassful
  to a pint of gravy; the quantity of brandy small in proportion.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Truffles</i> and <i>Morells</i> are a valuable addition to gravy and soup. Wash
  1 oz. of each, boil them five minutes in water, then put them and the liquor into the stew.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rump of Beef to Stew, Ragout, or Braise.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut out the bone, break it, and put it on in cold water, with any trimmings you can
  cut off the rump; season with onion, sweet herbs, a carrot, and a turnip. Scum, and let it simmer
  an hour; then strain it into the stew-pan in which you stew the beef. Season the rump highly with
  kitchen pepper (<i>which see</i>), and cayenne; skewer and bind it with tape. Lay skewers at the
  bottom of the stew-pan, place the meat upon them, and pour the gravy over. When it has simmered,
  rather more than an hour, turn it, put in a carrot, turnip, and 3 onions, all sliced, an eschalot,
  and a glass of flavouring vinegar. Keep the lid quite close, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page137">{137}</span>let it simmer 2 hours. Before you take it up, put in a little catsup,
  made mustard, and some brown <i>roux</i>, or butter rolled in flour, to thicken the
  gravy.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: having taken out the bone, lard the beef with fat bacon, and stew it for
  as many hours, as the beef weighs pounds, in good gravy, or plain water, with vegetables and
  seasoning, as in the other receipt, to which you may add a head of celery. This dish should be
  nicely garnished; for which purpose have carrots boiled, and cut into any shapes you like, also
  button onions, Brussels sprouts, sprigs of cauliflower, &amp;c., &amp;c.; a border of mashed
  potatoes round the meat, and carrot or green vegetables disposed upon it, is also nice. Stewed
  tomatas also, or tomata sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Brisket of Beef to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash, then rub the beef with salt and vinegar, put it into a stew-pan to just hold
  it, with water or broth; when it boils scum well, and let it stew an hour; add carrots, turnips,
  and onions, cut up. Stew it 6 hours, take out the bones, skim the gravy, add butter rolled in
  flour, a little catsup and mixed spices. Put the meat into a dish; add made mustard, and more
  catsup, to the gravy, pour some into the dish, and the rest in a tureen. This may be enriched by
  walnut and mushroom catsup, truffles, morells, and Port wine; also, carrots and turnips cut in
  shapes, boiled separately, and, when the meat is dished, spread over and round it. Serve
  pickles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef, or Veal  la Mode.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The rump, the thick part of the flank, the mouse buttock, and the clod, are dressed
  as follows; take from 8 to 10 lbs. beef, rub well with mixed spices and salt, and dredge it with
  flour. Put some skewers at the bottom of a stew-pan, and on them thin slices of bacon, 2
  table-spoonsful of vinegar, and a pint of good gravy or broth; then put in the beef, and more
  bacon. Cover close, and let it stew slowly 3 hours; then turn the meat, and put in cloves, black
  and Jamaica peppers, 2 bay leaves, and a few mushrooms, or catsup, also a few button onions,
  browned in the frying-pan, and a head of celery. Let it stew till the meat is tender, then take
  out the bay leaves, put in a tea-cupful of Port <span class="pagenum"
  id="page138">{138}</span>wine, and serve the meat with the gravy in the dish. The gravy will have
  thickened to a glaze. Some cooks lard the beef with thick slices of fat bacon, first dipped in
  vinegar, then in a mixture ready prepared, of black pepper, allspice, a clove and parsley, chives,
  thyme, savoury and knotted marjoram, all chopped very fine. Serve <i>salad</i> or <i>cucumber</i>.
  When veal is dressed this way (the breast is best), flavour with oyster catsup, lemon peel, lemon
  pickle, mace, bay leaf, and white wine. Garnish with pickled mushrooms, barberries, and lemon.
  This may be cooked in the oven, in a baking dish with a close fitting lid.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef to Collar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The thin flank is best; the meat young, tender, not very fat. Rub it with salt and
  a very little saltpetre, lay it across a deep dish one night, to drain; rub in a mixture of brown
  sugar, salt, pounded pepper and allspice; let it lie a week in the pickle; rub and turn it every
  day. Then take out the bones, cut off the coarse and gristly parts, and the inner skin, dry it,
  and spread over the inside some chopped herbs of whatever flavour you choose, and mixed spices;
  roll it up as tight as you can, and bind with tape; allow it four or five hours' slow, but
  constant boiling. When done press it under a heavy weight, and put by to eat cold. It is sometimes
  served hot.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>B&#x0153;uf Royale.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Bone the brisket, then scoop holes or cut slits in the meat, about an inch asunder,
  fill one with small rolls of fat bacon, a second with chopped parsley and sweet herbs, seasoned
  with pepper and salt, the third with oyster cut small and powdered with a very little mace and
  nutmeg. When all the apertures are stuffed, tie up the meat in a roll, put it into a baking pan,
  pour over it a pint of sherry, quite hot, and six cloves, flour the meat, cover close and set it
  in the oven for three hours; pour off the gravy, and put it by to cool that you may skim off the
  fat; if it is not already in a jelly, which it should be, boil it a little longer. Serve the beef
  cold, and the jelly round it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef to Fricandeau.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Lard a piece of lean beef with strips of bacon, seasoned <span class="pagenum"
  id="page139">{139}</span>with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice; put it into a stew-pan,
  with a pint of broth, a faggot of herbs, parsley, half a clove of garlic (if you like), one
  eschalot, four cloves, pepper and salt. Let it stew till tender, take it out and keep hot by the
  fire; strain the gravy, and boil it quickly, till reduced to a glaze; and glaze the larded side of
  the beef. Serve on stewed sorrel or cucumbers.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox Cheek to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Having washed the cheek, tie it up round, and stew it in good gravy, or water, with
  two bay leaves, a little garlic (if approved), two onions, mushrooms, two turnips, two carrots,
  half a small cabbage, a bunch of sweet herbs, six whole peppers, a little allspice, and a blade of
  mace. Scum well, and when nearly done, take out the cheek, cut off the tapes, put it into a fresh
  stew-pan; strain the liquor, skim off the fat, add lemon juice, or vinegar, salt, cayenne, and
  catsup; whisk in some white of egg to clear it, pour it through a strainer, to the cheek; and stew
  it till quite tender.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox Palates.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Parboil them till the upper skin will easily come off, and either divide, or cut
  them in slices. Stew them slowly, in gravy thickened with browned flour, with a little minced
  eschalot or onion, or a spoonful of onion pickle, some catsup, and cayenne. If to be dressed high,
  add wine, mushrooms, truffles, and morells to the sauce, and forcemeat balls in the dish. Stewed
  cucumbers with this.&mdash;<i>Beef skirts</i> the same way.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: boil the palates in
  milk, and serve them in white sauce, flavoured with mushroom powder and mace.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Pickle Ox Palates.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Clean and simmer them in water, scum well, then put as much mace, cloves, pepper,
  salt, and sweet herbs, as will make them highly seasoned, and let them boil gently 4 hours, or
  till quite tender; then take the skin off, cut them into small pieces, and set them by, to cool.
  Cover them with a pickle of half white wine, half vinegar, and spices as above: when this is cold,
  strain it, and pour over the palates; add 2 bay leaves, if you like. Cover very close.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page140">{140}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Bouilli.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">See this in direction for soup. But if to be dressed without soup, boil a piece of
  the flank or brisket in water to cover it, with a sufficiency of cut carrot and turnip to garnish,
  also a head of celery and 12 or 16 button onions, browned; add a small table-spoonful of black and
  Jamaica peppers tied in muslin; simmer it gently; and it requires a long time to cook it enough.
  When it has boiled till tender, take out enough of the liquor to make sauce; thicken it with brown
  <i>roux</i>, or flour rubbed in butter, add catsup, cayenne, and made mustard. Garnish with the
  vegetables. Caper, walnut, or tomata sauce. Pickled gherkins on the table.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tongue to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off the root, and boil a salted tongue tender enough to peel. Stew it in good
  gravy, with herbs, celery, soy, mushroom catsup, and cayenne. To be very rich this is served with
  truffles, morells, and mushrooms. Lard it if you like.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put the tongue into a pan
  that will just hold it, strew over a mixture of pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, and thin
  slices of butter, put a coarse paste over, and bake it slowly, till you think a straw will pass
  through it. To eat cold.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ox Tails to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Divide them at the joints. Scald or parboil, then brown them in a stew-pan, with a
  little piece of butter, to keep from burning. Stew them slowly till tender, in broth or water,
  enough to make sufficient gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne, chopped parsley, and a
  spoonful of made mustard. Thicken the gravy with brown flour. If you approve, put into the stew
  three onions (one brown), two carrots, and a bay leaf; or you may boil some cut carrots and
  turnips, stew them in melted butter, and serve round the pieces of meat in the gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Irish Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This excellent dish is made of mutton or beef. Chops cut from a loin or neck of
  mutton, trimmed of most of the <span class="pagenum" id="page141">{141}</span>fat, and well
  seasoned with salt, pepper, and spices. Parboil and skin as many potatoes as you think enough, the
  proportion is 4 lbs. weight to 2 lbs. of meat. Peel 8 or 10 onions (for 4 lbs. meat), lay some
  sliced suet at the bottom of the stew-pan, or a tea-cupful of melted butter, put in a layer of
  potatoes sliced, a layer of chops, slice a layer of onions over, then potatoes and mutton, and so
  on, the top layer potato; pour in half a pint of broth or water. A shank or small piece of ham is
  an improvement. This should stew very slowly; when the meat is tender the potatoes <i>may</i> be
  boiled to a mash, therefore have some boiled whole, by themselves. Beef steaks, and any of the
  coarser parts, make a better stew than mutton.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rump Steaks to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The steaks should be of one thickness, about  of an inch. Put about 1 oz. of
  butter into a stew-pan, and 2 onions sliced, lay in the steaks, and let them brown nicely on one
  side, then turn them to brown on the other side. Boil a large tea-cupful of button onions three
  quarters of an hour, strain, and pour the liquor over the steaks; if not enough to cover them, put
  a little more water or broth, add salt, and 10 peppercorns. Stew them very gently half an hour,
  then strain off as much of the liquor as you want for sauce; put it into a saucepan, thicken with
  brown flour, or <i>roux</i>, add catsup, a little cayenne, also a glass of red wine. Lay the
  steaks in a dish, and pour the sauce over. The boiled onions may be laid over the steaks.
  Mushrooms stewed with steaks are an improvement; 2 or 3 tomatas, also, will help to enrich the
  stew, and about 4 pickled walnuts may be put in. Harvey's and Reading sauces may be used to
  flavour, also chili or eschalot vinegar. <i>With Cucumbers, or Potatoes.</i>&mdash;Having your
  steak either broiled or fried, pour over it the following:&mdash;3 large cucumbers and 3 onions,
  pared, sliced, browned in the frying-pan, and then stewed till tender in  pint of gravy or
  water.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: cut the under side of the sirloin into steaks, broil them three parts, rub
  a piece of butter over each, and finish in the Dutch oven: serve them on potatoes, parboiled, cut
  in slices and browned.&mdash;<i>Italian Steak</i>: have a large tender one, season it with salt,
  pepper, <span class="pagenum" id="page142">{142}</span>and onion, or eschalot: put it, without any
  water, into an iron stew-pan, with a close-fitting lid, and set it by the side of a strong fire,
  but do not let it burn: in 2 hours, or a little more, it will be tender: serve, in its own
  gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rolled Beef Steaks.</i></p>

  <p>Prepare a forcemeat of the breast of a fowl,  lb. veal,  lb. ham, fat and lean, the kidney of
  a loin of veal, and a sweetbread, all cut very small, also a few truffles and morells stewed, an
  eschalot, a little parsley, thyme and grated lemon peel, the yolks of 2 eggs,  a nutmeg and 
  pint of cream, stir this mixture over the fire ten minutes, then spread it on very tender steaks,
  roll them up and skewer them; fry them of a fine brown, then take them from the fat, and stew them
  a quarter of an hour with a pint of beef gravy, a spoonful of catsup, a wine-glassful of Port
  wine, and, if you can, a few mushrooms. Cut the steaks in two, serve them the cut side uppermost,
  and the gravy round. Garnish with lemon or pickled mushrooms.&mdash;The forcemeat may be less
  rich, according to what you have.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A <i>fillet of beef</i>, namely, the under cut of the rump, makes very nice steaks;
  cut in pieces  inch in thickness, put them on the gridiron over a sharp fire, season them whilst
  broiling with pepper and salt, and turn them often, to keep the gravy in. Make a sauce of the
  yolks of 4 eggs,  lb. butter, in slices, salt, pepper, the juice of  a lemon, and a little
  chopped parsley; keep stirring it over the fire in every direction, till rather thick, then take
  it off and keep stirring until the butter is melted; if too thick, add milk or cream, and pour
  round the steak.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Olives.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut slices, of  an inch thick, about 5 long, and 3 inches broad. Beat, dip them in
  egg, then in a seasoning of chopped herbs, bread-crumbs, salt, mixed spices, and a little finely
  shred suet. Roll up and fasten them with thread. These may be roasted in a Dutch oven, or stewed
  in clear gravy, after being browned in the frying pan. Thicken the gravy, and add catsup and
  walnut pickle; dish <span class="pagenum" id="page143">{143}</span>the olives, skim, and pour the
  gravy hot over them. They may be made of slices of cold roast beef, forcemeat spread over them,
  and when neatly tied up, stewed in gravy, or boiling water, with brown flour rubbed in butter, to
  thicken it.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: spread on the slices of beef this mixture; mashed potatoes worked to
  a paste, with cream, the yolks of 2 eggs, and 1 spoonful of flour, seasoned with salt and pepper;
  when this is spread on the slices, strew over each a very little finely chopped onion, parsley,
  and mushrooms; roll the olives up, fry in butter, or bake in a Dutch oven.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Take the bone out of a round, and rub in the following mixture, all in fine powder:
   lb. saltpetre,  lb. lump sugar, 1 oz. cloves, 2 nutmegs, and 3 handfuls of salt; this for 25
  lbs.; rub and turn it every day, till you think it salted enough to boil; take it out of the
  brine, wipe it with a sponge, and bind up firmly with tape. If you choose, a stuffing may be put
  into the place where the bone came out. Put the meat into an earthenware pan just to hold it, with
  a pint of broth or thin melted butter; put some pieces of butter or suet on the top of the beef,
  lay folds of brown paper over the pan, or a coarse crust is still better, and bake it at least
  five hours. This is generally eaten cold, but it may be eaten hot. The gravy left in the pan is
  preserved to flavour soups and sauces. It may be made of the <i>Ribs</i>: rub into a piece of 12
  lbs., boned, 4 oz. bay salt, 3 oz. saltpetre,  lb. coarse brown sugar, 2 lbs. salt, and a

  outside to make gravy, with the bones; put these on in a quart of water, pepper, salt, two onions,
  a little allspice, cayenne, sweet herbs, and parsley: when the water has wasted one half, thicken
  with flour, <span class="pagenum" id="page145">{145}</span>mixing it in by degrees, a little at a
  time; when this has boiled up, skim off the fat, set it by the side of the fire to settle, strain

  ingredient you choose; when hot, put in the slices of meat, and all the gravy left of the joint;
  let the meat slowly warm through, but not <i>boil</i>, or it will become hard; a very few minutes
  will be sufficient. Toasted sippets round the dish. You may add any flavouring sauce you choose;
  eschalot vinegar is good, but use no onion. A table-spoonful of curry paste makes it a good

  it over the fire a few minutes, pour it in a dish, and when cool, put enough flour to make it into
  balls, the shape and size of large eggs; brush with egg, roll them in bread-crumbs, and brown
  before the fire. Pour good gravy over them. The minced beef may be warmed in scallop shells,
  between layers of mashed potatoes, or only a layer spread thinly over the top, and little bits of
  butter stuck on, and then browned before the fire: this may be moistened with any gravy you have,
  or walnut pickle.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: you may serve the mince on toasted bread, or under poached

  minced eschalot. Put it into potting-cans, and pour clarified butter <span class="pagenum"
  id="page147">{147}</span>over, which may afterwards be used for various purposes. <i>Potted
  Beef</i> is generally made of meat which has been used to make clear gravy, <i>or</i> the remains
  of a joint.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mock Hare.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put the inside of a sirloin of beef into an earthen pan, cover it with Port wine,
  and let it lie 24 hours: then spread over it a forcemeat of veal, suet, and anchovies, chopped,
  also grated bread, mace, pepper, and mushroom powder, lemon peel, lemon thyme, eschalot, and the
  yolks of two eggs: roll up the beef tight, and roast it, by dangling before the fire: baste with
  the wine in which it was soaked, till half done, then with cream, or milk and butter, and froth
  it, till well coated, like hare. Serve a rich gravy, flavoured with walnut or mushroom catsup, and
  a table-spoonful of eschalot vinegar. Sweet sauce.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: a cold uncut inside of a
  roasted sirloin may be re-warmed whole, in gravy flavoured with eschalot vinegar, walnut or
  mushroom catsup, and Port wine.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fillet of Veal to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stuff it with a good forcemeat, roll tightly, and skewer it. Lay skewers at the
  bottom of a stew-pan, place the meat on them, put in a quart of broth, or soft water, lay some
  bits of butter on the top of the fillet, cover the stew-pan close, after taking off all the scum,
  and let it simmer slowly till the meat is tender; take it out, strain the sauce, thicken it, and
  put it on the fire to re-warm; season with white pepper, mace, nutmeg, a glass of white wine, and
  the juice of a lemon, pour it hot over the meat; lay slices of lemon, forcemeat balls, pickled
  mushrooms, or fresh ones stewed, over the meat, and round the dish. Serve white sauce.&mdash;This
  dish is made more savoury if you put mushrooms, and ham or tongue, in the forcemeat. Also, you
  make it richer by putting the best part of a boiled tongue, whole, where you take the bone out,
  fill up the cavities round the fillet with forcemeat; tie it up in a good shape, and either stew
  or bake it, in gravy, as above; or roast it, basting well. This may be served with a wall of
  mashed potatoes round, and that ornamented with pieces of tongue and bacon, cut in dice,
  alternately, with sprigs of green <span class="pagenum" id="page148">{148}</span>vegetable; or
  pieces of stewed cucumber; or Jerusalem artichokes cooked in white sauce; or garnish with lumps of
  young green peas.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Neck of Veal to Braise.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Lard the best end with bacon rolled in a mixture of parsley, salt, pepper, and
  nutmeg: put it into a stew-pan with the scrag end, a slice of lean ham, 1 onion, 2 carrots, and 2
  heads of celery, nearly cover with water, and stew it till tender, about two hours. Strain off the
  liquor, and put the larded veal (the upper side downwards) into another stew-pan, in which you
  have browned a piece of butter, then set it over the fire, till the meat is sufficiently coloured;
  keep it hot in a dish whilst you boil up quickly a little of the strained liquor; skim it, put in
  a glass of Madeira, some orange or lemon juice, and pour it hot over the veal. Garnish with slices
  of lemon.&mdash;This joint may be covered with a veal caul and roasted; ten minutes before it is
  done, uncover it to brown. Serve it on sorrel sauce, celery, or asparagus tops: or with mushrooms
  fricasseed, or in sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Breast of Veal to Stew, Ragout, or Collar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">An elegant dish for the second course. Put on the scrag and any bones of veal you
  have, to make gravy; put a well seasoned forcemeat into the thin part, sew it in; egg the top of
  the breast, brown it before the fire, and let it stew in the strained gravy an hour; when done,
  take it out and keep it hot over boiling water, while you thicken the sauce, and put to it 50
  oysters cut up, a few mushrooms chopped, lemon juice, white pepper and mace; or catsup and anchovy
  sauce may be used to flavour it; also cream, white wine, truffles, and morells, at discretion.
  Pour the sauce hot over the meat, and garnish with slices of lemon and forcemeat balls, also
  pickled mushrooms.&mdash;A <i>Scrag</i> of veal is very good, stewed in thin broth or water, till
  very tender; make a sauce of celery, boiled in two waters to make it white, then put into very
  thick melted butter, stir in a coffee-cupful of cream, shake it two minutes over the fire, and
  pour it over the veal. <i>Or</i> tomata or onion sauce. <i>To Ragout</i>&mdash;Make a little gravy
  of the scrag and bones of <span class="pagenum" id="page149">{149}</span>the breast, cut the meat
  into neat pieces, rather long than broad, and brown them in fresh butter. Drain off the fat, and
  stew them in the gravy, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a piece of lemon peel, a few cloves, a blade
  of mace, two onions, white pepper, salt, and a little allspice. Simmer slowly, keeping it covered
  close. When done, take out the meat, skim off the fat, strain and thicken the gravy, add the juice
  of a lemon and a glass of white wine, and pour it hot over the veal, holding back the sediment.
  <i>Breast</i> and <i>neck of veal</i> may be stewed in water, or weak broth, without forcemeat.
  <i>Veal</i> is sometimes stewed with green peas, chopped lettuce, and young
  onions.&mdash;<i>Lamb</i> may be dressed this way, and served with cucumber
  sauce.&mdash;<i>Rabbit</i> the same, with white onion sauce. <i>To Collar</i>&mdash;Bone it, take
  off the skin, and beat the meat with a rolling pin; season it with pepper, salt, pounded mace, and
  a mixture of herbs, chopped very fine, then lay on thick slices of ham or 2 calves' tongues,
  boiled and skinned; bind it up in a cloth, and fasten it well with tape. Simmer it in enough water
  to cover it, over a slow fire, till quite tender, which will be about three hours and a half; then
  put it under a weight till cold. You may put in, in different parts, pigs' and calves' feet boiled
  and taken from the bones; also yolk of hard-boiled egg, grated ham, chopped parsley, and slices of
  beet root. <i>Collared Veal to be eaten Hot</i>&mdash;Spread a forcemeat over the breast (boned),
  then roll, bind it up tight, and stew it in water or weak broth. Serve it in good veal gravy, or
  on fricasseed mushrooms, and artichoke bottoms. This is sometimes roasted.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal Olives or Veal Rolls.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut long thin slices and beat them, lay on each one a very thin slice of bacon, and
  then a layer of highly seasoned forcemeat, in which there is a little eschalot. Roll them tight
  the size of two fingers 3 inches long; fasten them with a skewer, rub egg over, and either fry
  them of a light brown, or stew them, slowly, in gravy. Add a wine-glassful of white wine, and a
  little lemon juice.&mdash;If you do not choose the bacon, put only forcemeat strongly flavoured
  with ham; or grate ham thickly over the slices. Garnish with fried balls and pickled
  mushrooms.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page150">{150}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Scotch Collops.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut small slices of the fillet, flour and brown them in fresh butter in the
  frying-pan, and simmer them very gently in a little weak broth or boiling water; when nearly done,
  add the juice of a lemon, a spoonful of catsup, a little mace, pepper and salt; take out the
  collops, keep them hot in the dish; thicken the sauce with browned flour, and pour it hot over the
  collops; garnish with curled slices of bacon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal en Fricandeau.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The fat fleshy side of the knuckle, a little thin slice from the fillet, or the
  lean part of the neck boned. Take off the skin, beat the meat flat, and stuff with forcemeat; lard
  it, or not, as you like. Lay some slices of bacon at the bottom of a stew-pan, the veal on them,
  and slices of bacon on the top; put in 1 pint of broth, or water, the bones of the meat, or 2
  shanks of mutton; a bunch of herbs, 1 turnip, 1 carrot, 3 onions sliced, a blade of mace, 2 bay
  leaves, some white pepper, and lastly, more slices of bacon. Let this stew slowly, after being
  scummed, two hours, keeping the stew-pan closely covered, except when you baste the upper side of
  the fricandeau. The meat ought to be cooked to eat with a spoon. Take it out, when done, and keep
  it hot while you take all the bones out of the gravy, skim off the fat, and let it boil quickly
  till it thickens, and becomes a glaze; pour it over the meat. Mushrooms, morells and truffles may
  be added. Sorrel or tomata sauce.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: put the veal into a stew-pan, the larded
  side uppermost, add 2 tumblers of water, 2 carrots and onions in slices, 2 cloves, pepper and salt

  the grain, in slices smaller than cutlets, season with salt and kitchen pepper, dredge with flour,
  and brown them in another stew-pan. Then strain the broth, pour it over them, and stew it
  <i>very</i> slowly half an hour; thicken the gravy with white <i>roux</i>, and add the juice of
  half a lemon. <i>With Rice</i>&mdash;Cut off steaks for cutlets, or a pie, so as to leave no more
  meat on the bone than will be eaten hot. Break and wash the shank bone; put it into a stew-pan,
  with two quarts of water, salt, an onion, a blade of mace, and a bunch of parsley. When it boils,
  scum well, put in  lb. of well-washed rice, and stew it at least two hours. Put the meat in a
  deep dish, and lay the drained rice round. Serve bacon and greens.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Granadin of Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Line a dish, or shape, with veal caul, letting it hang over the sides of the dish;
  put in, first a layer of thin slices of bacon, then a layer of forcemeat, made of herbs, suet, and
  crumbs of bread, then a layer of thin slices of veal, well seasoned, and so on till the dish is
  filled; turn the caul over the whole, tie a paper over the dish, and bake it. Mushrooms may be
  added. When done, turn it out of the dish, and serve with a clear brown gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal  la Daube.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off the chump, and take out the edge-bone of a loin of veal; raise the skin and

  stew-pan, with all the bones and trimmings, one or two shanks of mutton, and just cover with
  water, or broth; a bunch of sweet herbs, two anchovies, some white pepper, and a blade of mace.
  Put a cloth over the stew-pan, and fit the lid tight, with a weight on the top. Simmer it slowly
  two hours, but shake the pan occasionally. The gravy will have become a strong glaze; take out the
  veal, the bacon, and herbs; glaze the veal, and serve it with tomata or mushroom sauce, or stewed
  mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal to Haricot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Shorten the bones of the best end of the neck; you may <span class="pagenum"

  roast it an hour. Pour a sauce of melted butter and catsup over it.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: stuff, and
  brown it in a stew-pan, with a little butter, or a slice of bacon under it; put in enough broth or
  water to make a very little gravy, and let it simmer gently till done; take out the bacon, simmer
  and thicken the gravy, and pour it over the heart. Sweet sauce, or currant
  jelly.&mdash;<i>Sheep's</i> hearts are very nice, in the same way; a wine-glassful of catsup, or
  of Port wine, in the gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Calf's Pluck.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Parboil half the liver and lights, and mince them. Stuff the heart with forcemeat,
  cover with the caul, or a buttered paper, or, instead of either, lay some slices of bacon on, and
  bake it. Simmer the mince of the liver in gravy or broth, add salt, pepper, chopped parsley, the

  middle, the slices round. Garnish with fried parsley, or toasted sippets.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: cut the
  liver into oblong slices an inch thick, turn these round, and fasten with thread, or form them
  into any shape you like. Chop onions very fine, also mushrooms and parsley, fry these in butter,
  pepper and salt; then dredge flour over the pieces of liver, and put them into the frying-pan;
  when done enough, lay them in a dish, pepper slightly and keep them hot, whilst you pour enough
  broth or boiling water into the frying-pan to moisten the herbs; stew this a few minutes, and pour
  it over the liver. A nice supper or breakfast dish.&mdash;<i>Lamb's pluck</i> the same
  way.&mdash;<i>Calf's liver</i> is very good stewed. This is made rich, according to the herbs,
  spices, and sauces used. Chili vinegar is good.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal Sweetbreads.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Parboil a very little, then divide and stew them in veal broth, or milk and water.
  When done, season the sauce with salt and white pepper, and thicken with flour; add a little hot
  cream, and pour it over the sweetbreads.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: when parboiled, egg the sweetbreads, dip
  them in a seasoned mixture of bread-crumbs, and chopped herbs; roast them gently in a Dutch oven,
  and pour over a sauce of melted butter and catsup.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: do not parboil, but brown
  them, in a stew-pan, with a piece of butter, then pour over just enough good gravy to cover them;
  let them simmer gently, till done, add salt, pepper, allspice and mushroom catsup; take out the
  sweetbreads, thicken the sauce with browned flour, and strain it over them. Mushroom sauce and
  melted butter are served with sweetbreads.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: par-roast before the fire, cut them in
  thin slices, then baste with thin melted butter, strew bread-crumbs over, and finish by broiling
  before the fire.&mdash;Truffles and morells may be added to enrich the gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Calf's Tails.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Clean and parboil the tails, brown them in butter, then drain and stew them in good
  broth, with a bunch of parsley, a few onions, and a bay leaf. Green peas, sliced <span

  when done, and the fat skimmed off.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Calf's Head.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash and soak it in warm water, take out the brains, and the black part of the
  eyes. Boil it in a large fish-kettle, with plenty of water and some salt. Scum well, and let it
  simmer gently nearly two hours. Lift it out, carefully sponge it to take off any scum that may
  have adhered, take out the tongue, and slightly score the head, in diamonds; brush it with egg,
  and sprinkle it with a mixture of bread-crumbs, herbs, pepper, salt and spices; strew some little
  bits of butter over, and put it in the Dutch oven to brown. Wash and parboil the brains; skin, and
  chop them with parsley and sage (parboiled); add pepper and salt, with melted butter, to a little
  more than moisten it, add the juice of a lemon, and a small quantity of cayenne; turn this a few
  minutes over the fire: skin the tongue, place it in the middle of a small dish, the brains round
  it; garnish with very small sprigs of curled parsley, and slices of lemon; serve the head in
  another dish, garnish the same. Serve melted butter and parsley. If you have boiled the whole
  head, half may be dressed as above, and the other half as follows:&mdash;cut the meat into neat
  pieces along with the tongue, and re-warm it in a little good broth, well seasoned with spices and
  lemon peel; when it is done, put in the juice of a lemon, pour it into your dish, lay the half
  head on it, garnish with brain cakes and lemon.&mdash;<i>Calf's Head to Stew</i>&mdash;Prepare it
  as in the last receipt to boil; take out the bones, put in a delicate forcemeat, tie it up
  carefully, and stew it in veal broth or water; season well with mace, mushroom powder and a very
  little cayenne. Stew very slowly, and when done, serve it with fried forcemeat balls, and a
  fricassee of mushrooms. It may be enriched to almost any degree, by flavouring sauces, truffles
  and morells, also oysters. <i>A Collared Calf's Head</i> in the same way: when boned season as in
  the last receipt; put parsley in a thick layer, then thick slices of ham or the tongue, roll it
  up, tie as firmly as you can in a cloth and boil it, and put it under a weight till cold.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page155">{155}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Brain Cakes.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take off all the fibres and skins which hang about the brains and scald them; beat
  them in a bason, with the yolks of two eggs (or more, according to the quantity of brains), one
  spoonful of flour, the same of bread-crumbs, a little lemon peel grated, and two tea-spoonsful of
  chopped parsley; add pepper, salt, nutmeg, and what spices you like; beat well together, with
  enough melted butter to make a batter; then drop it, in small cakes, into boiling lard, and fry of
  a light brown. Calf's or lamb's brains, in this way, for garnishing, or a small side dish.
  <i>Brains  la Matre d'Hotel</i>: Skin the brains and soak them in several waters, then boil them
  in salt and water, with a little piece of butter, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Fry in butter,
  some thin slices of bread, in the shape of scollop shells. Lay these in a dish, the brains divided
  in two on them, and pour over a Matre d'Hotel sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Calf's Head to Fricassee, and to Hash.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">First parboil, then cut the meat into small pieces, and stew it, in a very little
  of the liquor in which it was boiled, or in rich white gravy, seasoned with white pepper, salt,
  onion and sweet herbs. Simmer gently, and, when nearly done, thicken with butter, rolled in flour,
  and just before you dish it, add a tea-cupful of hot cream, or the yolks of two eggs beaten; let
  it simmer, but not boil. Garnish with brain cakes, or curled slices of bacon.&mdash;<i>To
  Hash</i>: Calf's head cold, makes an excellent hash, and may be enriched to any degree, by adding
  to the following plain hash, some highly flavouring ingredients, such as sweetbreads, truffles,
  artichoke bottoms, button mushrooms, forcemeat and egg balls.&mdash;Cut the head and the tongue
  into slices. Take rather more than a quart of the liquor in which it was boiled, two shanks of
  mutton, or bones or trimmings of veal, and of the head; a bunch of sweet herbs, parsley, one large
  onion, a piece of lemon peel and some white pepper; boil this slowly, so that it may not waste too
  much, till it is well flavoured gravy, then thicken it with butter rubbed in flour, and strain it
  into a clean saucepan, add pounded mace, a large spoonful of oyster catsup or lemon pickle,
  sherry, and <span class="pagenum" id="page156">{156}</span>any sauce you like; put in the slices
  of meat, and warm them by gently simmering. Garnish with forcemeat balls, curled slices of bacon,
  or fried bread, in sippets, or brain cakes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mock Turtle.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak a large head, with the skin on, in hot water, then parboil it, in sufficient
  water to cover it, with a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 onions and a carrot; and after it has boiled to
  throw up the scum, simmer it gently half an hour. Then take the head out and let it get nearly
  cold before you cut it up. Take out the black parts of the eyes, and cut the other part into thin
  round slices, the gristly parts of the head into strips, and the peeled tongue into dice or square
  bits. Put the bones and trimmings of the head back into the stew-pan, and keep it simmering by the
  fire. Fry some minced eschalot or onion, in plenty of butter dredged with browned flour; then put
  it into a clean stew-pan, with all the cut meat, toss it over the fire a few minutes, then strain
  into it, a sufficient quantity of the stock to make the dish a stew-soup; season with pounded
  mace, pepper, salt, and a pint of Madeira; simmer it very slowly, till the meat is done, add a
  large spoonful of catsup or soy, a little chopped basil, tarragon and parsley. It must be skimmed
  before it is served; add the juice of a lemon, and pour it into a tureen. Forcemeat balls may be
  used as garnish: this is made richer by a cow heel, and also, by sweetbreads parboiled, or oysters
  and anchovies being added.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal to Mince.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cold veal is generally used to mince, but undressed meat is the most savoury. Mince
  it finely, only the white part, and heat it in a little broth, or water (a piece of butter rolled
  in flour, if the latter), salt, white pepper, pounded mace, and plenty of finely chopped or grated
  lemon peel; when warm, put to it a small coffee-cupful of hot cream, and serve with sippets round
  the dish. This preparation does for <i>patties</i> or <i>cecils</i> or <i>scallops</i>, the same
  as directed for <i>beef</i>.&mdash;You may mix with the mince some stewed mushrooms. <i>Veal</i>
  may be <i>hashed</i> the same as beef; adding to the gravy, mace, nutmeg, and lemon peel.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page157">{157}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal to Pot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Season a thick slice of an undressed fillet, with mace, peppercorns and 3 cloves,
  bake or stew nearly four hours, pound it quite small in a mortar, with salt, and butter
  sufficient, just melted. Put it in pots, and cover with clarified butter. A portion of ham is an
  improvement.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal Cake.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 8 eggs hard, cut two in half, the others in rings, put some of the latter and
  the halves round the bottom of a deep dish or shallow mould, and between each, a light sprig of
  parsley to make a layer; then a layer of very thin small pieces of cold veal, ham or tongue, and
  sprigs of parsley between, and more egg, moisten as you go on with a very good savoury jelly,
  flavoured with cayenne.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: make a very pretty dish; having boiled two calf's feet or
  a cow heel for jelly, or other purpose, put some nice little bits of the meat at the bottom of a
  deep round pudding mould, and little bits of ham or tongue and sprigs of parsley between, season
  to taste, then another layer, till full, moisten as you go on with some of the liquor. Set in a
  rather cool oven just to stiffen, then in a cool place, and turn it out of the shape. Bunches of
  barberries to garnish it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mutton to Haricot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the neck or loin, into chops, and trim off all the fat and bones. Have 3 pints
  of good broth, in which a turnip, carrot, bunch of parsley and 3 onions have been boiled. Season
  the chops well with kitchen pepper, and flour them; then brown them in the frying-pan, with a
  piece of butter, put them in a stew-pan, and pour the strained broth over. Let them stew very
  slowly half an hour, then put in 2 large carrots, cut in slices, and notched on the edges, 10 or
  12 pieces of turnip, cut in fanciful shapes, 6 button onions, previously half roasted in the
  frying-pan, or parboiled, also a head of celery, cut up. When the chops are tender, skim the
  gravy, thicken it with browned flour; add pepper and salt, and a table-spoonful of walnut catsup,
  the same of camp sauce, of universal sauce, <span class="pagenum" id="page158">{158}</span>of
  chili or eschalot vinegar, and a wine-glassful of either Port or white wine. Lay the chops in a
  hash dish, the vegetables on them, and pour the gravy hot over. <i>Cucumbers</i> sliced,
  <i>endive</i> parboiled and cut up, or <i>haricots</i> parboiled, are good in this. <i>Veal
  cutlets</i>, <i>beef steaks</i>, and <i>lamb chops</i>, in the same way. Young lettuces and celery
  are more suitable to veal than turnip and carrot. Garnish with pickled mushrooms.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Leg of Mutton with Carrots.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Lard the leg and put it in a stew-pan just large enough to hold it, with a piece of
  butter. Set it over the fire five or ten minutes, and turn it to every side; take it out, and mix
  in the saucepan, with the butter, a spoonful of flour, and two tea-cupsful of broth or boiling
  water; let this simmer, turning the saucepan often; put in the mutton, and fill up with broth or
  boiling water; add salt and pepper, and a small bunch of herbs. Boil it slowly two hours, then put
  in a large plate of carrots cut in small pieces, and browned in another saucepan. Boil the mutton
  another hour after the carrots are added, and then serve it. Any lean joint of mutton may be
  cooked in this way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Loin of Mutton to Roll or to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Keep it till quite tender, take out the bones, and put them on in water to cover

  <p class="ac"><i>Fowl  la Chingara.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut a fat fowl down the back and breast, then across, to be in four equal parts.
  Melt a very little piece of butter in a stew-pan, put in four slices from the thickest part of a
  boiled ham, then the fowl, and stew it gently, till done; take out, keep it hot, pour the fat off
  the glaze at the bottom of the stew-pan, and pour in a little good gravy, salt, pepper, and
  cayenne. Simmer gently a few minutes, during which, fry, in the fat you have poured off, four
  toasts, dust over them a little pepper and salt, place them in a dish, a quarter of the fowl on
  each; either with the ham or not. Skim the sauce, and serve in a tureen.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cold Fowl or Turkey to Pull.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take off the skin, and pull the meat off the breast and wings, in long flakes;
  brown these in the frying-pan with a piece of butter, drain them from the fat, put them into a
  saucepan with a little gravy previously seasoned with salt, pepper, nutmeg and mace. Simmer
  gently, to warm the meat; during which, score and season the legs, if turkey, and broil them, with
  the sidebones and back. Thicken the sauce with the yolks of two eggs, and add a tea-cupful of hot
  cream. Serve the hash in the middle, the broil round. Garnish with toasted sippets. Mushroom sauce
  good with this. <i>Boudins</i> are made thus: mince the meat which is left on fowl or turkey; put
  a tea-spoonful of chopped onion and a piece of butter into a stew-pan and turn it over the fire,
  for a minute or two, then put in a table-spoonful of flour and mix it well, a pint of stock and
  the mince, season with pepper, salt, and sugar; simmer it till heated through, and then stir
  quickly in, the yolks of three eggs well beaten, stir it over the fire, but do not let it boil,
  and pour it out on a dish to get cold; divide it into equal parts, and roll them round or to your
  fancy, egg and bread-crumb them two or three times, and fry of a light brown. These may be
  flavoured with ham, tongue or mushroom cut up in the mince.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Goose or Hare to Braise.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stuff it for roasting, lay thin slices of bacon over it; line a stew-pan with
  bacon, put the goose and giblets in the centre, 5 or 6 onions, 2 carrots and turnips, a clove of
  garlic, all sliced, salt, black and Jamaica peppers, 2 bay leaves, and a slight sprinkling of
  finely chopped herbs. Moisten with boiling water. Lay a sheet of paper over, cover close, lay a
  folded cloth over the lid, put a weight on the top to keep it tight, and stew gently. (<i>See
  instructions for braising.</i>) Apple, pear, or currant jelly sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Turkey or Hare en Daube.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Lard the breast and legs of the turkey with strips of bacon, with salt, pepper,
  spices, and herbs; and lay slices of bacon over the breast. Line a stew-pan with bacon, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page172">{172}</span>and put in the turkey, with a hock of ham or a calf's
  foot (both if you can), also the head and feet of the turkey, 4 onions, 2 carrots, young onions, a
  few sprigs of thyme, a bunch of parsley, and 6 cloves; moisten this, with a tea-cupful of melted
  butter, and cover it with white paper. Simmer it five hours; take it off the fire, and let it
  stand by the side twenty minutes, or half an hour. Take out the turkey, strain the gravy, and boil
  it down quickly; beat up an egg, stir it into the gravy, put it on the fire, and let it come
  nearly to a boil, then stand by the side of the fire half an hour, and it will be a jelly; strain
  it again if not clear, and pour it over the turkey.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pigeons to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put a piece of butter, rolled in flour, a little chopped parsley, and the liver,
  into each pigeon, truss, then place them on slices of bacon, in a stew-pan; cover with more slices
  of bacon, and stew them three quarters of an hour. Serve good brown gravy. Stewed mushrooms, if
  liked. Garnish with sprigs of boiled cauliflower, or small heads of brocoli. <i>Or</i>: add
  bread-crumbs to the stuffing, truss them for roasting, and brown them in the frying-pan; then put
  them into the stew-pan, with good stock of beef, flavoured with herbs, mace, anchovies, mushroom
  powder, onions, and pepper; stew till tender, then add oyster, mushroom and walnut catsup, Port
  and white wine, soy, Gloucester and camp sauces. Garnish with egg balls and pickled
  mushrooms.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: first stuff them with bread-crumbs, spices, parsley, and a little
  fresh butter; half roast them in a Dutch oven, and finish in the stew-pan, in good gravy; to which
  wine, lemon peel, and mushrooms may be added. Pour it over the pigeons. Asparagus may be laid
  round and between them.&mdash;<i>Pigeons in Jelly</i>&mdash;Pick, wash, and singe two plump
  pigeons; leave the heads and feet on, clean them well, clip the nails close to the claws, and
  truss them, propping the heads up with skewers; season inside with pepper and salt, and a bit of
  butter in each. Put a quart of the liquor of boiled knuckle of veal, or calf's head or feet, into
  a baking-dish, with a slice of lean ham, a blade of mace, a faggot of sweet herbs, white pepper,
  lemon peel, and the pigeons. Bake them in a moderate oven; when done, take them out <span
  class="pagenum" id="page173">{173}</span>of the jelly, and set by to get cold, but cover them to
  preserve their colour. Skim the fat off the jelly when cold, then boil it up with the whites of 2
  eggs beaten, to clear it, and strain through a bag. Place the pigeons in a dish, the clear jelly
  round, and over them, in rough heaps. Instead of baking, you may roast the pigeons, and when cold,
  put a sprig of anything you like into their bills, place them on some of the jelly, and heap more
  of it round.&mdash;<i>Pigeons in Forcemeat</i>&mdash;Spread a savoury forcemeat in a dish, then in
  layers, very thin slices of fat bacon, young pigeons cut up, sliced sweetbreads blanched, 2
  palates boiled tender and cut up, mushrooms, asparagus tops, cockscombs and the yolks of 4 eggs
  boiled hard; spread more forcemeat on the top, bake it, and turn it out in a dish, with rich gravy
  poured round. <i>Pigeons en Compote.</i>&mdash;Parboil 2 large pigeons; take them out of the
  water, and squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the breast of each. Have prepared in a stew-pan
   lb. of butter, a table-spoonful of flour, and 2 tea-cupsful of weak broth, a faggot of herbs,
  pepper, salt, a piece of ham and 8 mushrooms in quarters: place the pigeons in this, and stew them
  slowly till tender. Blanch 12 button onions, and a  of an hour before they are done, put them in
  the stew-pan. When done, take out the herbs and ham, skim the gravy, pour it over the pigeons, in
  a dish, and the onions round.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ducks with Peas.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Season them with salt, pepper, cayenne and mixed spices. Lay some very thin slices
  of bacon in a stew-pan, the ducks on them, more slices over them, moisten with broth, or water,
  and stew them from half to a whole hour, according to their age, and size. While they are stewing,
  parboil, and fry in butter, or with bits of bacon, 2 or 3 pints of young green peas, pour off the
  fat, put them in a stew-pan with a very little water or broth, salt, pepper, sugar, a bunch of
  parsley, and some young onions. Take the onions and parsley out from the peas, skim off the fat,
  and pour the gravy over the ducks.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: half roast the ducks, and stew them in a pint
  of good gravy, a little mint, and 3 sage leaves chopped small, cover close and let it stew half an
  hour. Boil a pint of green peas as for eating, and put them in, after you have thickened the <span

  peas over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ducks to Ragout.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Prepare them the same as pigeons to stew, brown them all round, in the frying-pan,
  then stew them in good broth, till tender. Season well with pepper, salt, onions, sage, and what
  other herbs you like. Thicken the sauce with browned flour and butter. Add a glass of Port, if you
  like, and pour it over them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ducks to Hash.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut them up, as at table, and if you have not any gravy suitable, prepare some of
  the trimmings, 3 onions, a bunch of herbs, pepper, salt, sugar, and spices. Strain, thicken it,
  and put in the pieces of duck; do not let the gravy even simmer, but keep hot by the side of the
  fire until the meat is heated through. Port wine or catsup, and cayenne may be
  added.&mdash;<i>Goose</i> may be hashed in this way, the legs scored, seasoned and broiled, laid
  on the hash, or served by themselves.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Wild Fowl to Ragout.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Half roast the bird, score the breast in 3 at each side, lightly strew mixed spices
  and cayenne into each cut, squeeze lemon juice over the spices. Stew it till tender, in good brown
  gravy, take it out and keep hot; add 1 or 2 finely shred eschalots to the gravy, also a glass of
  Port wine, and pour it over the wild fowl; any game may be re-warmed cut up, in good gravy,
  boiling hot, thickened with bread-crumbs, and seasoned with salt, spices to taste, wine, and lemon
  juice, or pickle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Snipes, Landrails or Woodcocks to Ragout.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pick 2 or 3 very carefully, take out the trail, and lard them with slices of fat
  and lean ham, dredge well with flour, and fry in butter of a light brown: then stew in good gravy,
  flavoured with sherry or Madeira, Port or claret, anchovy, oyster, and lemon pickle, and walnut
  catsup, 2 table-spoonsful of soy, cayenne and Gloucester sauce. Thicken with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page175">{175}</span>flour and butter. Just before serving add the juice of a lemon, and 1
  table-spoonful of eschalot vinegar. Pound the trail with salt, lay it on slices of buttered toast,
  before the fire, put it in a deep dish, serve the ragout over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Partridge or Wild Duck Salmi.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Par-roast two partridges, which have been kept long <i>enough</i>, when cold, skin
  and carve them, put them into a small saucepan with one eschalot, a bit of lemon peel, a very
  little dressed ham in small bits, all the trimmings of the birds, a large glass of Madeira, half a
  wine-glassful of the best olive oil, pepper, salt, cayenne and the juice of a lemon. When just
  heated through, dish the birds on a very hot dish, pour the strained sauce over, and serve very
  hot, with grilled toasts. A little good sauce of veal gravy, the trimmings, cayenne, and the juice
  of a bitter orange; then put in the pieces of duck, and simmer till hot.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tripe to Fricassee.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stew a piece of the thick part in well-seasoned veal stock. Cut it in strips, shake
  it over the fire in white sauce, five minutes; squeeze the juice of a lemon in the dish, pour the
  fricassee in, and garnish with slices of lemon. If maigre, cream and yolk of egg will enrich
  it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mock Brawn.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Having cleaned a hog's head, split it, take out the brains, cut off the ears, and
  rub the head well with salt. Let it drain for twelve hours, spread 2 oz. common salt and 1 oz.
  bay salt over it, and the next day put it into a pan, cover with cold water, and let it stand a
  day and night. Then wash well, and boil it until the bone comes out; skin the head and tongue, and
  cut both into bits. Put half of the skin into a pan, spread the meat in layers, season with salt
  and pepper, press it down hard, and cover with the other half of the skin. If too fat, add bits of
  lean pork. Make a pickle of 2 oz. salt, a pint of vinegar, and a quart of the liquor; boil it
  three times, and when cold pour it over.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page176">{176}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tripe in the Scotch Fashion.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">First boiled and cold; then simmer it gently in milk and water, with salt, and a
  piece of butter. When quite tender, take it out, and let it cool, whilst you prepare a thick
  batter of three eggs, three spoonsful of flour and some milk; add green onions or chives, parsley
  chopped fine, and ginger. Cut the tripe in square cutlets or strips, dip them in the batter, thick
  enough to form a thick crust, and fry in beef dripping.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Scotch Haggis.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Having cleaned a sheep's pluck, cut some places in the heart and liver, to let out
  the blood, and parboil it all (during which the windpipe should hang over the side of the pot in a
  bowl, that it may empty itself). Scum the water, as the pluck boils: indeed, it ought to be
  changed. From half to three quarters of an hour will be sufficient. Take it all out, cut off about
  half of the liver, and put it back to boil longer. Trim away all pieces of skin and black-looking
  parts from the other half of the liver, the heart, and part of the lights, and mince all together,
  with 1 lb. of beef suet and three or four onions. The other half of the liver having boiled half
  an hour longer, put it in the air to get cold; then grate it to the mince, and put more onions if
  you like, but slightly parboiled. Toast a large tea-cupful of oatmeal flour; turn it often with a
  spoon, that it may be dried equally of a light brown. Spread the mince on a board, and strew the
  meal lightly over, with salt, pepper and cayenne. Have ready the haggis bag (it is better to have
  two, for one may burst), put in the meat, with broth to make a thick stew; the richer the broth
  the better; add a little vinegar, but take care that the bag be not too full, for the meat must
  have room to swell. When it begins to boil, prick the bag with a needle; boil it slowly, three
  hours. The <i>head</i> may be parboiled, minced and added.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Curry of Chicken, Rabbit, or Veal.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Read in the Chapter on Seasonings, the part relating to Curry
  Powder.</i>&mdash;Curry may be made of cold meat, and makes a variety with the common mode of
  re-warming <span class="pagenum" id="page177">{177}</span>meat, but not so good a <i>Curry</i> as
  when made of undressed meat. Cut the meat into pieces, as are served at table, and brown them, in
  butter, with 1 or 2 sliced onions, over a quick fire. When of a fine amber colour, put it and the
  onions in a saucepan, with some veal, mutton broth, or stock of poultry and veal, or mutton
  trimmings; when this has simmered long enough to cook the meat, put in the curry powder, from 2 to
  3 dessert-spoonsful, according to the quantity of meat, rubbed and mixed very smooth with a
  spoonful of flour; stir this carefully in the sauce, and simmer it five minutes; when done, put in
  the juice of a lemon, and stir in by degrees a coffee-cupful of thick cream. A small part of the
  meat and the livers of poultry may be pounded to thicken the sauce.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: rub the
  powder into a thin paste, with cream, and rub each piece of meat with it, when half cooked, then
  return it to the saucepan to finish stewing.&mdash;<i>Another</i>&mdash;Fry 4 large sliced onions
  in 2 oz. of butter, and put all into a stew-pan, with either a loin of lamb in steaks, a breast of
  veal cut up, chicken, duck or rabbit jointed, or any thing undressed and <i>lean</i>, with a pint
  of good stock, or more, according to the quantity of meat; stew till tender: then take out the
  meat, and mix with the gravy about 2 dessert-spoonsful of turmeric powder, 6 pounded coriander
  seeds, cayenne to taste, and 2 table-spoonsful of chili, or eschalot vinegar. Boil these till
  thoroughly mixed and thick, and till the turmeric has lost the raw flavour; then put in the meat,
  and give it one boil. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon or a lime, and serve it <i>very hot</i>, in
  a deep dish, with plenty of gravy; the rice in another.&mdash;Stewed onions, stewed cucumbers, or
  stewed celery, <i>brown</i>, are good with curry. Serve pickles (melon mangoes most suitable), and
  chili vinegar.&mdash;<i>Veal cutlets</i> fried with onions in butter, and stewed in gravy as
  above. <i>Lamb</i>, <i>Duck</i>, <i>Cow-heel</i>, and <i>Lobster</i> make good curries. Indeed
  tender <i>steaks</i> and <i>mutton chops</i> are also very good dressed in curry.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Curry Kebobbed.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut into bits, either chicken and tongue, or veal and ham; season with eschalot,
  and fasten them in alternate slices on small skewers. Mix with flour and butter 2
  dessert-spoonsful of curry powder, or 1 of curry paste, 1 of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page178">{178}</span>turmeric, and add by degrees  pint of good gravy. Fry the meat with 3
  onions, chopped in butter, and put all into a stew-pan with the gravy, a tea-spoonful of mushroom
  powder, a wine-glassful of sherry or Madeira, 2 table-spoonsful of lemon pickle, 2 of garlic or

  <p class="ac"><i>Curry of Fish.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Slices of <i>cod</i>, <i>turbot</i>, <i>brill</i>, and <i>halibut</i>, also
  <i>whitings, haddocks</i>, and <i>codlings</i>, may all be curried. To be maigre, make the gravy
  of well-seasoned fish stock; if not, of beef or veal broth, in which an onion and carrot have been
  boiled; thicken with butter rubbed in browned flour. Bone the fish, and cut them into neat pieces,
  rub with flour, and fry them in butter, of a light brown. Drain them on a sieve. Mix very smoothly
  a table-spoonful of curry powder (more or less according to the quantity of fish), with a
  dessert-spoonful of flour, and mix it to a paste with a little of the broth; add 2 onions, beaten
  in a mortar, and  pint of thick cream, mix this in the gravy, or roll the piece of fish in it,
  then put them in the gravy, and stew them gently till tender; place them in a dish, skim the fat
  off the sauce, and pour over the fish.&mdash;<i>Lobsters</i>, <i>prawns</i>, <i>shrimps</i>,
  <i>oysters</i>, and <i>muscles</i> are curried in the same way, to form a dish by themselves, or
  with other fish.&mdash;Slices of <i>cold</i> cod, turbot, or brill are re-warmed in curry
  sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef or Ham Chutney.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To 1 oz. of grated meat, put 1 small onion chopped very fine, 1 tea-spoonful of

  <p class="ac"><i>Rice to Boil for Curry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pick, and soak it in water; then boil very quickly, with a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page179">{179}</span>little salt in the water, till tender, but not soft; drain, and lay it on
  a sieve reversed, before the fire, to dry. Turn it with a fork, as lightly as possible, but do not
  use a spoon. Serve it in a dish by itself; or round the dish in light heaps, the curry in the
  middle. After it is boiled, some cooks pour cold water over, and then set it before the fire to
  dry. Every particle ought to be distinct, yet perfectly tender.&mdash;<i>Another</i> way is, to
  wash it in warm water, pick it carefully, pour boiling water over it in a stew-pan, cover that
  close, and keep it by the side of the fire to be quite hot. In an hour's time, pour off the water,
  set the stew-pan on the fire, and stir briskly with a fork till the rice is dry, but not
  hard.&mdash;The <i>Hindostanee</i> mode is this: when well picked, soak it in cold water a quarter
  of an hour; strain and put it into boiling water rather more than enough to cover it; boil it ten
  minutes, skimming, if necessary; then add a gill of milk for each lb. of rice, and boil it two or
  three minutes; take it off the fire, strain, and put it back into the saucepan over a slow fire;
  pour on it  oz. of butter melted, and a table-spoonful of the water in which it was boiled; boil
  it slowly, another eight minutes, and it will be ready.&mdash;In <i>Carolina</i> they soak the
  rice two hours in salt and water, wash it, put it in a bag of cheese cloth, then steam it twenty
  minutes, and each grain will be separated.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Pillau.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stew some rice in broth, or melted butter, till tender, season with salt, pepper,
  and mace. Prepare a boiled fowl, or mutton chops, or veal cutlets, dressed as you like; place them
  in a hot dish, and if fowl or veal, slices of boiled bacon over; cover the meat with the rice,
  glaze it with beaten egg, and place it before the fire, to brown. Garnish with hard-boiled egg and
  slices of lemon.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: half roast a breast of veal, cut it in pieces, season with
  pepper and salt (curry powder, if you like), and stew them in gravy, or broth. Place a high border
  of rice round a dish, the veal in the centre, thin slices of bacon on it, and cover with rice,
  glaze with yoke of egg, and brown it. A turkey capon, or old fowl, larded, may be dressed in this
  way; or cold poultry, or rabbit.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page180">{180}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sausages.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To the following receipts saltpetre may be added, to give a red hue. Mushrooms and
  oysters give a nice flavour, but the sausages do not keep well. Sausage meat may be cooked without
  skins: mould it into flat cakes, moistening with yolk of egg, to bind, and then fry them. These
  cakes form a pretty supper dish, garnished with curled parsley; also a garnish for roast turkey or
  fowl. The ingredients must be <i>well mixed</i>. Herbs ought to be used sparingly. <i>Pork
  Sausages.</i>&mdash;Cut 3 lbs. of fat, and 3 lbs. of lean pork, into thin slices, scrape each one,
  and throw away the skin; cut the meat altogether, as small as possible, with 2 oz. salt,  oz.
  pepper, 6 tea-spoonsful of sage, chopped fine, 2 nutmegs, and 2 eggs. Boil a pint of water, let it
  get cold, put in the crumb of a penny roll, to soak all night; the next morning mix it with the
  other ingredients, and fill the skins. <i>Oxford Sausages.</i>&mdash;To 1 lb. pork, add 1 lb.
  veal, 12 oz. beef suet, 3 oz. grated bread, 3 eggs, well beaten, with mace, black pepper, salt,
  and sweet herbs, these last chopped, then pounded in a mortar, before they are put to the other
  ingredients. Anchovy is an improvement.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: leave out the bread, herbs and suet, have
  plenty of fat to mix with the lean, mix it with yolk of egg, into long thin cakes, and fry them.
  <i>Epping Sausages.</i>&mdash;Equal portions of young tender pork, and beef suet. Mince them very
  finely, season with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, and a little chopped sage. <i>Veal
  Sausages.</i>&mdash;Equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon,  a handful of sage leaves, salt,
  pepper, and a few anchovies; beat all well in a mortar. Roll this into cakes and fry them.
  <i>Bologna Sausages.</i>&mdash;An equal portion of beef, veal, lean pork and fat of bacon, minced
  and mixed well together. Season with pepper, salt, and spices; fill a large skin, and boil it an
  hour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rissoles.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Any sort of cold meat, but veal, chicken, turkey and sweetbreads are best. Mince
  the meat, season with salt and pepper, and stew it two minutes in well-seasoned gravy; use no more
  than sufficient to moisten the mince. Let it get cold, then roll into balls; dip these into egg
  beaten; then into bread-crumbs, and fry them of a light <span class="pagenum"
  id="page181">{181}</span>brown. When done, place them in a dish, and pour good gravy into
  it.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: roll out thin puff paste, spread some mince on it, and roll up, in what shape
  you please; fry of a light brown. Rissoles may be made of cold turbot, shrimps, lobster and cod;
  season with cayenne and thin melted butter; add the yolk of an egg to bind it, then roll up in
  thin puff paste and fry them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Bread Border.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut slices of firm stale bread, the thickness of the blade of a knife, into any
  shape you like. Heat some top fat, or oil, in a saucepan, and put in the sippets. Take some out
  before they are much browned, and let the rest brown more. Drain well, fasten each one up with
  white paper, until you are ready to use them; then pierce the end of an egg, let out a little of
  the white, beat it up with a knife, and mix in a little flour. Heat a dish, dip one side or point
  of each sippet in the egg, and stick them, one by one, on the dish, in what form you please, and
  put the ragout or fricassee in the centre.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Rice Border.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak the rice well, then stew it with salt and a blade of mace; to be richer, use
  butter and yolk of egg. When just tender, and no more, place it round the dish, as an edging;
  glaze with beaten yolk of egg, and set it in the oven, or before the fire, a few minutes; then put
  in the curry, or hash, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoe Border.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Omelets.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">These with practice, are easily made, and are convenient to make out a dinner or
  supper, especially in the country, where fresh eggs may almost always be obtained. Omelets are so
  common in France, that the poorest inn by the road <span class="pagenum"
  id="page182">{182}</span>side will always furnish one. <i>Fresh</i> eggs are essential; the
  frying-pan should be round and small. The basis of most omelets is the following: beat well the
  yolks of 6 and the whites of 3 eggs, put to them a little salt and 2 table-spoonsful of water; put
  1 oz. fresh butter into the frying-pan, and hold it over the fire; when the butter is hot, pour
  in the eggs, shake the pan constantly, or keep stirring the eggs till they become firm, then with
  a knife lift the edge all round, that the butter may get under. If over done, it will be hard and
  dry. Gather the border up, roll the omelet, and serve in a hot dish. This may be flavoured in
  various ways: with grated lemon peel, nutmeg and mace; <i>or</i> with the juice of a Seville
  orange; <i>or</i> with grated ham, tongue, <i>or</i> veal kidney, pepper and salt; <i>or</i>
  finely chopped parsley, green onions, chives and herbs: <i>also</i>, for maigre dinners, lobster
  meat, shrimps or the soft parts of oysters may be pounded, seasoned and put into the eggs. A
  pounded anchovy, and, also, mushroom powder, may be used to give flavour. Potatoe or wheaten
  flour, about a table-spoonful, is sometimes added to the eggs.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Eggs to Poach.</i></p>

  the top of the egg with a knife, and let it slip gently into the boiling water, turning the shell
  over the egg, to gather in the white; this is said to be a better way than to break the egg into a
  cup, then turn it into the water. Let the saucepan stand by the side of the fire till the white is
  set, then put it over the fire for two minutes. Take them up, with a slice; trim them, and serve
  on toasts, spinach, brocoli, sorrel, slices of broiled ham, or in the centre of a dish, with pork
  sausages round.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">With</span> regard to the flavouring ingredients to be used in making these,
  no precise instructions can be given, because what is disagreeable to one palate is indispensable
  to another one, therefore, practice alone will teach a cook how to succeed in the art of forcemeat
  making; and so many flavouring condiments may be used that she may vary her forcemeats to almost
  any variety of dishes, taking care that no one flavour predominates, but the whole be so blended
  that the proper zest be given without too much poignancy. Some choose the flavour of onions,
  thyme, and other herbs, to be strong, while others dislike even a very little of either. Onion is
  milder for being parboiled in two waters, and some think the flavour of eschalot
  preferable.&mdash;Suet is indispensable; but if it cannot be obtained, beef marrow, or good fresh
  butter, are the best substitutes.&mdash;Bread-crumbs are better soaked in milk, than grated dry;
  in the former case their quantity must be <span class="pagenum" id="page188">{188}</span>judged by
  bulk, not by weight: the bread should be stale. The French use <i>Panada</i>, and prepare it thus:
  Soak slices of bread in hot milk, when moist press out the milk from the bread, and beat the
  latter up, with a little rich broth or white sauce, and a lump of butter. Stir till somewhat dry,
  add the yolks of 2 eggs, and pound the whole well together. Sweetbreads make delicate forcemeat
  flavoured with tongue.</p>

  <p>Stuffing and forcemeat require to be well pounded in a mortar, and thoroughly mixed: it ought

  <p>Gravy ought to be perfectly clear and free from fat; flavoured, to suit the dish it is intended

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page192">{192}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Some very good cooks use <i>brandy</i> in making sauces, particularly for ragouts;
  <i>sugar</i> also.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>White Roux.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Melt slowly 1 lb. of good butter in a little water, then stir in 1 lb. of fine,
  well dried flour; stir till as thick as paste, then simmer it a quarter of an hour, stirring all
  the time, or it will burn. It will keep two or three days. The common mode of browning soup and
  gravy with burnt sugar is not so good as brown flour, but the browning is prepared thus: put  lb.
  of fresh butter with  lb. of lump sugar into a saucepan, shake it often, and when of a clear
  brown bottle it for use.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Brown Flour.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Spread flour on a plate, set it in the oven, or before the fire, and turn often,
  that it may brown equally, and any shade you like. Put it by in a jar for use.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Brown Roux.</i></p>

  <p>Melt butter very slowly, and stir in browned flour; it will not require so long as to cook
  white <i>roux</i>, because the flour has been browned. Will keep two or three days. When you use
  either of these <i>Roux</i>, mix the quantity you wish (a table-spoonful for a tureen of soup),
  with a little of the soup or gravy quite smooth, then use it.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The basis of most English sauces is melted butter, yet English cooks do not excel
  in making it, and the general fault is deficiency of butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Melt Butter, the French Sauce Blanche.</i></p>

  <p>Break  lb. of good butter in small pieces, into a saucepan, with 3 table-spoonsful of sweet
  cream, or milk, milk and water, or water alone; dredge fine dried flour over, hold the saucepan
  over the fire, toss it quickly round (always one way) while the butter melts, and becomes as thick
  as very thick cream; let it just boil, turn the saucepan quickly, and it is done.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Butter for oysters, shrimps, lobsters, eggs, or any <span class="pagenum"
  id="page193">{193}</span>thickening ingredient, should be made rather thin, and if to be rich, a
  great proportion of cream. If for catsup or any flavouring ingredient, melt the butter with water
  only, and stir the ingredients in, by degrees, just before you serve it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Brown Butter.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Toss a lump of butter in a frying-pan, over the fire, till it becomes brown. Skim,
  then dredge browned flour over, stir round with a spoon till it boils; it ought to be quite
  smooth. This, adding cayenne, and some flavouring vinegar, is a good fish sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Parsley and Butter, or Maitre d'Hotel Sauce.</i></p>

  <p>Tie the parsley in a bunch, and boil it in salt and water, 5 or 10 minutes, according to its
  age, drain it, cut off the stalks, mince very fine, and stir it into melted butter.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Fennel</i>, <i>basil</i>, <i>burnet</i>, <i>cress</i>, <i>chervil</i>, and
  <i>tarragon</i> the same. When you have not the fresh vegetable, boil celery or parsley seeds in
  the water to be used with the butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Ham Extract.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut away all skin and the fat of an undressed ham; cut out the bone, and put it
  into a large saucepan, with 3 quarts of water, 2 large carrots, 3 onions (2 in slices), a bunch of
  sweet basil and parsley, 3 cloves, and a table-spoonful of mushroom powder: let this simmer by the
  fire two hours; stirring up the vegetables from time to time; then take out the bone, put in the
  meat, and stew it 3 hours, or till the liquor, when strained and cold, is a jelly. A
  table-spoonful will flavour a tureenful of soup, and half the quantity in melted butter, is good
  sauce for poultry and game. Also good in veal and chicken pie.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Draw Plain Gravy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Notch and flour 1 lb. of gravy beef, or an ox melt, and put it in 1 pint cold
  water; scum carefully, and stew gently, till all the juice is extracted from the meat, and about
  half an hour before it is done, put in a piece of crust of bread. When done, strain and clear it

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Gravy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This, the basis of many rich sauces, is made of lean juicy meat. Cut 4 lbs. into
  thin slices, and score them; place a slice of streaked bacon, or the knuckle of a ham, at the
  bottom of a stew-pan, the beef upon it, and bits of butter; add half a large carrot, 3 onions,
  half an eschalot, and 3 heads of celery, all cut up; also a bunch of sweet herbs. Brown it over
  the fire, shaking the saucepan occasionally; in half an hour the juices will be drawn; then put in
  2 quarts of boiling water, scum well, and when that is no longer necessary, wipe the edges of the
  saucepan and lid, and cover close. Simmer 3 hours, by the side of the fire; let it stand to
  settle, then strain it into an earthen vessel, and put it by in a cool place. For hare, add an
  anchovy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Savoury Gravy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Line a stew-pan with thin slices of ham or bacon, and add 3 lbs. of fillet of veal,
  or 2 of beef, in slices, a carrot and onion; moisten this with a tea-cupful of broth. The juices
  will form a glaze. Take the meat out on a dish, pick it all over, put a little more broth, or
  boiling water, add young onions, parsley, and sweet herbs to taste, also celery, cayenne, a bay
  leaf, mushrooms, and garlic, if you like; and after it has been scummed, simmer very gently.
  Strain, and then stand it in a cool place. This gravy may be enriched and flavoured at the cook's
  discretion. Wine, flavoured vinegar, truffles, morells, curry powder, tarragon, anchovy, pickled
  mushrooms and oysters, may be used to suit the dish it is required for.&mdash;Some cooks use more
  carrots and onions than I have directed.</p>

  water, and add a carrot, 3 onions, parsley, thyme, 2 bay leaves, and chopped mushrooms, if
  convenient. Let the meat heat through, without burning, and prick it, to let the juices flow. When
  the knuckle is sufficiently cooked for the table, take it out, let the stew-pan stand by the fire
  a few minutes, skim the fat off the sauce, strain, and boil it again till reduced to the quantity
  you require; thicken it with white <i>roux</i> (it can be thinned afterwards), boil it again, and
  skim if needful; keep stirring, lifting it often in a spoon and letting it fall, to make it smooth
  and fine. Sweet thick cream is a nice substitute for white <i>roux</i>, in this
  sauce.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put 2 lbs. of lean gristly veal, and  lb. lean bacon or ham, in little

  small bunch of parsley, lemon thyme and basil, a little pounded mace, nutmeg, and a few white
  peppercorns. Strain, boil it again, with a piece of butter rolled in flour, and at the last a

  lemon peel, and a little cayenne. Simmer for a minute, pour a little of it over the broil, and
  serve the rest in a tureen.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">SEASONINGS.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Except</span> in the matter of plain roasting, boiling, or baking, the test of
  good cooking is the taste and skill displayed in giving <i>flavour</i> to the composition. Care is
  not all that is required here; there needs study, and practice. No rules can be given, except to
  avoid over flavouring, and to suit the ingredients, as much as possible, to the compound which is
  to be flavoured. In order to be able always to do this, some forethought is requisite on the part
  of the housekeeper, who will save herself much vexation and trouble by keeping a small assortment
  of seasonings always ready for use in her <i>Store Room</i>; and by taking some little pains, to
  have a sufficient <i>variety</i>.</p>

  <p>Many prefer cayenne made from English chilies to any other: they are in season in September and
  October; cut off the stalks, and lay them before the fire to dry for twelve hours. When dry, pound
  them in a mortar with one fourth their weight in salt, till they are as fine as possible, and put
  the mixture into a close stopped bottle.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Before spices are rubbed into meat, they should be pounded, and well mixed. For the
  convenience of the cook they may be kept prepared in the following manner.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page207">{207}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Kitchen Pepper.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Fill little square bottles with an equal quantity of finely ground or pounded
  ginger, nutmeg, black pepper, allspice, cinnamon and cloves. Keep these corked tight, and when
  "kitchen pepper" is required, take the proper proportion of each, and mix them, with common salt.
  For <i>white sauces</i>, use white pepper, nutmeg, mace, lemon peel (dried), ginger and cayenne;
  pounded or grated, and kept in bottles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Savoury Powder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">1 oz. of salt,  oz. mustard,  oz. allspice,  oz. ginger,  oz. nutmeg,  oz.
  black pepper,  oz. lemon peel, and 2 drachms cayenne; grate and pound well together, pass the
  mixture through a fine sieve and bottle it.&mdash;Some leave out allspice and ginger, substituting
  mace and cloves.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Curry Powder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take 12 oz. of coriander seeds, 2 oz. cummin seeds, 1 oz. fenugreek seeds, 1 oz.
  ginger, 1 oz. black pepper, 4 oz. cayenne, and 2 oz. pale turmeric. Pound the whole and mix well
  together. Put these ingredients before the fire, stir and rub them frequently, till quite dry.
  Then set them by to get cold, rub through a hair sieve, and put them into a dry bottle, cork
  close, and keep in a dry place. A table-spoonful will make curry sufficient for one
  fowl.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: Take  lb. coriander seed, 2 oz. turmeric, 1 oz. cummin seed,  oz.
  black pepper, and cayenne to taste; then proceed in the same way.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: 2 oz.
  coriander seeds,  lb. turmeric; of black pepper, flour of mustard, cayenne and ginger, each 1
  oz.; of lesser cardamoms  oz., cummin seed  oz., and fenugreek seeds  oz.&mdash;<i>Another</i>:
  4 oz. turmeric in powder, 4 oz. of coriander, 2 oz. carraway seeds in powder, 2 oz. fenugreek, and
  cayenne to taste.&mdash;<i>Curry paste</i> is very good, but it may be better to prepare curry
  powder at home; for different curries require different flavouring; as fish and veal require more
  acid than fowls, rabbit, &amp;c., &amp;c. The ingredients may be kept in bottles, and mixed when
  used.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page208">{208}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Herbs.</i></p>

  <p>As these cannot always be procured green, it is convenient to have them in the house, dried and
  prepared, each in the proper season. The common method is to dry them in the sun, but their
  flavour is better preserved, by being put into a cool oven, or the meat screen, before a moderate
  fire, taking care not to scorch them. They should be gathered when just ripe, on a dry day.
  Cleanse them from dirt and dust, cut off the roots, put them before the fire, and dry them
  quickly, rather than by degrees. Pick off the leaves, pound and sift them; put the powder into
  bottles, and keep these closely stopped.</p>

  <p>Basil, from the middle of August, to the same time in September.</p>

  <p>Winter and Summer Savory, July and August.</p>

  <p>Knotted Marjoram, July.</p>

  <p>Thyme, Orange Thyme, and Lemon Thyme, June and July.</p>

  <p>Mint, end of June and through July.</p>

  <p>Sage, August and September.</p>

  <p>Tarragon, June, July, and August.</p>

  <p>Chervil, May, June, July.</p>

  <p>Burnet, June, July, August.</p>

  <p>Parsley, May, June, July.</p>

  <p>Fennel, May, June, July.</p>

  <p>Elder Flowers, May, June, July.</p>

  <p>Orange Flowers, May, June, and July.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The following mixture of herb powder is good for soups or ragouts: 2 oz. each of
  parsley, winter savory, sweet marjoram, and lemon thyme, 1 oz. each of sweet basil and lemon peel,
  cut very thin. For made dishes, the cook may keep this mixture, with one fourth part of savory
  powder mixed in it. Dried herbs may be infused in spirits of wine or brandy ten days or a
  fortnight; then strained, the spirit closely corked, and put by for use.&mdash;Some recommend the
  following mixture: infuse in 1 pint of wine, brandy, vinegar, or spirits of wine,  oz. each of
  lemon thyme, winter savory, sweet marjoram, and sweet basil, 2 drachms grated lemon peel, 2
  drachms minced eschalots, and 1 drachm celery seed: shake it every day for a fortnight, then
  strain and bottle it.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page209">{209}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Horse-Radish Powder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">In November and December, slice horse-radish the thickness of a shilling, and dry
  it, <i>very gradually</i>, in a Dutch oven; pound and bottle it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pea Powder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This gives a relish to pea soup. Pound 1 drachm celery seed,  drachm cayenne
  pepper,  oz. dried mint,  oz. of sage; when well mixed, rub through a fine sieve, and bottle
  it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mushroom Powder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash  a peck of large mushrooms, quite fresh, and wipe them with a piece of
  flannel; scrape out the black clean, and put them into a saucepan without water, with 2 large
  onions, 4 cloves,  oz. mace, and 2 tea-spoonsful of white pepper, all in powder; simmer and shake
  them till all the liquor be dried up, but do not let them burn; lay them on tins or sieves, in a
  slow oven, till dry enough to beat to a powder, then put it in small bottles, and keep them in a
  dry place. Cayenne, if you choose; a tea-spoonful sufficient for a tureen of soup. To flavour
  gravy for game, and for many made dishes. <i>Mushrooms to Dry.</i>&mdash;Wipe them clean, and take
  off the brown and skin; dry them on paper, in a cool oven, and keep them in paper bags. They will
  swell, when simmered in gravy, to their own size.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Anchovy Powder.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">Pound the anchovies, rub them through a hair sieve, then work them into thin cakes
  with flour, and a little flour of mustard. Toast the cakes very dry, rub them to a powder, and
  bottle it. For sauces, or to sprinkle over toasts, or sandwiches.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="XVIII. Vegetables" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER XVIII.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">VEGETABLES.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Persons</span> who live in the country, may generally have fresh vegetables;
  but in towns, and especially in London, the case is different; and vegetables not quite fresh are
  very inferior to those which have been only a short time out of the ground.&mdash;Take the outside
  leaves off all of the cabbage kind, and plunge the part you mean to cook into cold water, the
  heads downwards; let there be plenty of water, and a large piece of salt, which helps to draw out
  the insects. Examine the leaves well, and take off all the decayed parts. They should be boiled in
  soft water, to preserve their flavour, and alone, to preserve their colour. Allow as much water as
  the vessel will hold, the more the better; and a handful of salt. The shorter time they are in the
  water the better, therefore see that it boil fast, before you put the vegetables in, and keep it
  boiling at the same rate afterwards; let the vessel be uncovered, and take off all scum. When
  done, take them out of the water instantly, and drain them; they ought then to go to table, for
  vegetables, particularly green ones, suffer in look and in taste, every moment they wait.</p>

  <p>In dressing vegetables, as well as in making soup, the French greatly excel us, for they always
  cook them enough. Besides they make more of them than we do, by various ways of dressing them,
  with gravy and cream. Several receipts are here given, by which a side or supper dish, may be
  prepared at very little cost, particularly in the country, where fresh vegetables are always at
  hand.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Salads, if mixed with oil, are not injurious, except in peculiar cases, for they
  are cooling and refreshing in hot weather, and beneficial in many respects, in the winter. Most
  persons, particularly the Londoners, eat cucumbers, but strange to say, they do not, generally,
  value a well made salad so highly.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page211">{211}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoes to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The best way, upon the whole, is to <i>boil</i>, not steam them. Much depends upon
  the sort of potato, and it is unfair to condemn a cook's ability in the cooking of this article,
  until it be ascertained that the fault is really hers, for I have seen potatoes that no care or
  attention could boil enough, without their being watery, and others that it would be difficult for
  any species of cookery to spoil. They should be of equal size, or the small ones will be too much
  done before the large ones are done enough; do not pare or cut them; have a saucepan so large that
  they will only half fill it, and put in cold water sufficient to cover them about an inch, so that
  if it waste, they may still be covered; but too much water would injure them. Put the saucepan on
  the fire, and as soon as the water boils, set it on one side, to simmer slowly till the potatoes
  will admit a fork; the cracking of the skin being too uncertain a test; having tried them, if
  tender, pour the water off, and place the saucepan by the side of the fire, take off the cover,
  and lay a folded cloth, or coarse flannel, over the potatoes. Middling sized ones will be boiled
  enough in fifteen minutes. Some (and I believe it is the practice in Ireland), when they have
  poured off the water, lay the potatoes in a coarse cloth, sprinkle salt over, and cover them a few
  minutes, then squeeze them lightly, one by one, in the folds of a dry cloth, peel and serve them.
  Some peel potatoes for the next day's dinner and put them into cold water enough to cover them,
  over night; the water is poured off just before the potatoes are boiled. After the beginning of
  March potatoes should be peeled before they are boiled, and after April they should always be
  mashed. Potatoes may be dressed in various ways to make supper or side dishes, and there are
  sauces suitable to enrich them. <i>Young Potatoes.</i>&mdash;Rub the skin off with a cloth, then
  pour boiling water over them in a saucepan, let it simmer, and they will soon be done.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoes to Fry, Broil, or Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cold potatoes may be cut in slices and fried in dripping, or broiled on a gridiron,
  then laid on a sieve to drain; serve on a hot dish, and sprinkle a little pepper and salt <span
  class="pagenum" id="page212">{212}</span>over them. Garnish with sprigs of curled parsley, or the
  parsley may be fried and strewed over.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: when the potatoes are nearly boiled
  enough, pour off the water, peel and flour them, brush with yolk of egg, and roll them in fine
  bread-crumbs or biscuit-powder, and fry in butter or nice dripping.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: stewed gently
  with butter; turn them, while stewing; pour a white sauce in the dish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoes to Mash.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Peel them, cut out the specks, and boil them: when done, and the water poured off,
  put them over the fire for two or three minutes, to dry, then put in some salt and butter, with
  milk enough to moisten sufficiently to beat them to a mash. The rolling-pin is better than
  anything else. Cream is better than butter, and then no milk need be used. Potatoes thus mashed
  may be put into a shape, or scallop-shells, with bits of butter on the top, then browned before
  the fire; either way makes a pretty dish.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: they may be rolled up, with a very
  little flour and yolk of egg into balls, and browned in the dripping-pan under roast meat. These
  balls are pretty as a garnish.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: make them up into a <i>Collar</i>, score it, and
  brown it before the fire, then serve it with a brown gravy in the dish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Colcannan.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 4 lbs. potatoes, also as many of the inside leaves of curled kale as will fill
  a saucer. Mash the two together in the saucepan the potatoes were boiled in, to keep them hot; put
  a piece of butter in the centre, when you serve it. Some prefer parsley to kale, but use less.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoes to Roast.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Some cooks half boil them first. They should be washed and dried. If large, they
  will take two hours to roast, and should be all of a size, or they will not all be done
  alike.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: pour off the water, peel and lay them in a tin pan, before the fire, by
  the side of roasting meat. Baste, from the dripping-pan, and turn them to brown equally.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page213">{213}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoe Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Having washed and peeled the potatoes, slice them, and put a layer into the pie
  dish, strew, over a little chopped onion, small bits of butter, salt, and pepper (and, if you
  like, hard-boiled egg in slices), then put more potatoes, and so on, till the dish is full; add a
  little water, then stick over the top nearly  lb. of fresh butter, in bits; cover with a light
  puff paste, and bake an hour and a half.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoe Balls.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mash quite smooth 7 or 8 mealy potatoes, with 3 oz. of butter, 2 table-spoonsful
  cream, 1 of essence of anchovy, and 1 or 2 eschalots <i>very finely</i> chopped; make up into
  balls, dip them into egg beaten, and brown them. Garnish with curled parsley, for a side or supper
  dish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoe Ragout.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mash 1 lb. of potatoes with butter (no milk or cream), and grate in some ham,
  nutmeg, salt, pepper, 2 eggs beaten, and a very little flour. Mix well together, and form it into
  loaves, or long thin rolls, fry or stew of a light brown, for a garnish to veal cutlets, or a dish
  by themselves.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potatoes  la Matre d'Hotel.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil, peel, and cut the potatoes in slices  an inch thick, put them into a
  stew-pan with some young onions skinned, chopped parsley, butter (a large piece), pepper, salt,
  and a little broth to moisten the potatoes. Toss them till the parsley is cooked; serve with
  parsley and butter poured over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cabbages to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash well, and quarter them, if large. A young cabbage is done in from twenty
  minutes to half an hour, a full grown one will take nearly an hour. Have plenty of water, that
  they may be covered, all the time they are boiling; scum well. Serve melted butter. <i>Savoys,
  Sprouts, and Young Greens.</i>&mdash;Boil the same as cabbages, but twenty minutes will be
  sufficient.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page214">{214}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cabbage  la Bourgeoise.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash and pick quite clean a large cabbage; take the leaves off one by one, and
  spread upon each some forcemeat, made of veal, suet, parsley, salt, and pepper, mixed with a
  little cream and an egg; then put the leaves together, in the form of a whole cabbage, tie this up
  securely at each end, and stew it in a braise. When it is tender, take it out, and press in a
  linen cloth to clear it from the fat. Cut in two, in a dish, and pour good gravy over it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Cabbage to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Melt sufficient butter, to stew the quantity of cabbage; cut it into shreds and put
  it into a saucepan, with a chopped onion, 2 cloves, a bay leaf, cayenne pepper and salt. Keep the
  saucepan covered close, and when done, add a good spoonful of vinegar. This may be spread in a
  dish, and sausages served on it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cabbage, Greens, or Spinach to Curry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">After they are boiled, drain, chop and stew them in butter with curry powder to
  taste; the powder previously mixed with salt, pepper, and vinegar. It is an improvement to
  spinach, to add sorrel; and some like a small quantity of chopped onion. To these curries you may
  add minced veal, chicken or rabbit, and serve with a gravy of veal; <i>or</i>, if to be maigre,
  minced cold fish, prawns or oysters, and fish gravy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Spinach.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">As spinach harbours insects, and is often gritty, wash it in two or three waters;
  then drain it on a sieve. Some boil it in very little water, but this is not a good way. Put a
  small handful of salt into the water, and when it boils, scum well; put in the spinach, and boil
  it quickly till quite tender, ten minutes will be enough. Pour it into a sieve, then squeeze
  between two plates or trenchers, chop fine, and put it into a small saucepan, with a piece of
  butter and a little salt. Stir with a spoon, five minutes over the fire, spread in a dish, score
  nicely, and serve it hot.&mdash;<i>Spinach, Sorrel, and Chicory</i>, may be stewed, the two former
  in equal <span class="pagenum" id="page215">{215}</span>portions together, or all separately, for
  fricandeaus. Wash, pick, and stew very slowly, in an earthen vessel, with butter, oil, or broth,
  just enough to moisten them.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: do not put any liquid at all, but when tender, beat
  up the sorrel, &amp;c. &amp;c. with a bit of butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Spinach au Gras.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">When boiled, pour through a sieve and press it, to squeeze the water out; put a
  large piece of butter or dripping into a saucepan, and, when it has melted, put in some sippets of
  toasted bread for a few minutes, take them out and put in the spinach chopped fine, and a little
  good gravy of the day before, or out of the dripping-pan, if you be roasting meat, or some good
  broth, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and flour; simmer a few minutes, and serve with the toasts round it.
  <i>Au Sucre.</i>&mdash;Having boiled and squeezed all the water from spinach, chop, and put it
  into a saucepan with a good sized piece of butter, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little flour. Shake
  the saucepan over the fire a few minutes, then put in some cream or very good milk, to moisten the
  spinach, and 2 or 3 lumps of sugar, according to taste. Simmer very gently, and serve it garnished
  with toasts.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Asparagus and Sea Kale.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scrape the stalks quite clean, and throw them into a large pan of cold water. Tie
  them in bundles of equal size with tape, not string, as that is likely to break off the heads; cut
  the ends of the asparagus even, and having a pot of boiling water ready (it ought to be scummed
  when the water boils), put in the bundles. When the stalks are tender, the asparagus is done; but
  loses flavour by being a minute too long in the water; indeed, it is the only one which will bear
  being a <i>little firm</i>. Before it is done, toast the round of a loaf, dip it into the boiling
  water, lay it in a dish, and the asparagus on it. Serve melted butter with asparagus and kale. The
  French, when the butter is melted, beat up the yolk of an egg, and stir in it, by degrees, a small
  quantity of vinegar, enough to flavour it; stir well for two minutes over the fire, and it is an
  excellent sauce for asparagus, or any green vegetable.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page216">{216}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cauliflower and Brocoli.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose middling sized ones, close and white, trim off the outside leaves, and cut
  off the stalks at the bottom. Strip off all the side shoots, peel off the skin of the stalk, and
  cut it close at the bottom. Boil and scum the water, then put the vegetables in; cauliflower will
  be done in fifteen or twenty minutes, and spoiled if it boil longer. Brocoli in from ten to
  fifteen minutes. Lift out of the water with a slice. Serve melted butter. Both may be served on
  toasts, and the sauce for asparagus served with them, either for the second course or for
  supper.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cauliflower with Parmesan.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil nicely and place it in a dish (not a close one), grate cheese over, and then
  pour white sauce over. Brown it, grate more cheese, then pour more white sauce over. Brown it
  again before the fire, or with a salamander. Serve it with white sauce, or melted butter in a
  dish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cauliflower to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil a large cauliflower till nearly done, then lift it out very gently, separate
  it into small pieces, put these into a stew-pan, with enough rich brown gravy to moisten, and let
  it stew till tender. Garnish with slices of lemon.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: if you have no gravy, put into
  a stew-pan a piece of fat bacon, 2 or 3 green onions, chopped small, a blade of mace, and a very
  little lemon thyme, shake the stew-pan over the fire, ten minutes, then put in the cauliflower,
  let it brown, add a very little water, and let it stew.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: if to be a maigre, put a
  lump of butter into a saucepan, an onion minced, some nutmeg, salt, and pepper, shake the saucepan
  over the fire a few minutes, then put in the pieces of cauliflower, and pour in enough boiling
  water to moisten; simmer it a few minutes, add the yolks of 3 eggs well beaten, turn the saucepan
  over the fire till the eggs are cooked, then serve the cauliflower.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cauliflower or Brocoli to Fry.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil till nearly tender enough to eat, then pick it in nice <span class="pagenum"
  id="page217">{217}</span>pieces, dip them in a batter made of  lb. flour, the yolks of 3 eggs and
  a coffee-cupful of beer, pepper, and salt. Then fry the pieces in boiling lard, of a light brown,
  and put them on a sieve to drain and dry before the fire.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: dip them first in egg,
  then in fine crumbs of bread, and then egg again, before you fry them.&mdash;Celery and onions the
  same.&mdash;Serve white sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Peas.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">They should be shelled but a short time before they are cooked. The younger, of
  course, the better. When the water boils, scum it, put the peas in, with a little salt, and a
  piece of sugar, and let them boil quickly from fifteen to twenty minutes. When done, drain, and
  put them in a dish with some bits of fresh butter; stir the peas with a silver spoon, and cover
  the dish. Some like mint boiled with peas; others boiled alone, chopped, and laid in little lumps
  round them.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: after they are partly boiled, drain and stew the peas in a little
  broth, with a lettuce, a little green onion, and mint, or a sliced cucumber in the place of the
  lettuce; stew them till nearly done before you put in the peas; add a little salt, pepper, and
  brown or white sugar. Essence of ham, or mushroom catsup, may be added.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: when the
  peas are partly cooked, drain, and rub in some butter kneaded in flour, then stew them in weak
  broth, till quite done; add salt, a bunch of parsley, and green onions. Before you serve the peas,
  drain them, dip a lump of sugar into boiling water, stir it amongst them, and grate parmesan over.
  For maigre dinners, use more butter, instead of broth. <i>In White Sauce.</i>&mdash;Put quite
  young peas into a stew-pan, with a piece of butter, a cabbage lettuce, and a little each of
  parsley and chives. Do not add any liquor, but stew them very gently over a slow fire. When done,
  stir, by degrees,  pint cream, and the beat yolks of 3 eggs, into the peas; let it thicken over
  the fire, but not boil, then serve it. The peas which are eaten in their shells may be dressed in
  this way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Windsor Beans.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil in plenty of water, with salt, and a bunch of parsley. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page218">{218}</span>Serve parsley and butter; garnish with chopped parsley. The French
  parboil them, take off the skins, stew them, and when done pour a rich veal gravy over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>French Beans.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off the stalks, and if the beans are not young, string them, cut them in two,
  slantways; if old, split first, then cut them slantways; if very young, do not cut them at all.
  Lay them in water, with a little salt, for about half an hour. Then put them into water, boiling
  fast, and boil till tender. Serve melted butter. These beans may be stewed in all the ways
  directed for peas. <i>Beans  la Maitre d'Hotel.</i>&mdash;Warm them up in parsley and butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Turnips.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Some think turnips are most tender when not pared before they are boiled, but the
  general practice is to cut off a thick peel. Most persons slice them also, but it is not the best
  way. An hour and a half of gentle boiling is enough. When done, lift them out with a slice, and
  lay them on a sieve to drain; when dry, serve them. To very young turnips leave about an inch of
  the green top. <i>To Mash Turnips.</i>&mdash;Squeeze them as dry as possible between two
  trenchers, put them into a saucepan with a little new milk or cream, beat well with a wooden
  spoon, to mash them, add a piece of butter and a little salt; stir over the fire till the butter
  is melted, then serve them. It is an improvement to put in with the cream a table-spoonful of
  powdered sugar. <i>To Ragout.</i>&mdash;Turnips may be made a ragout to serve under or round meat.
  Cut in slices an inch thick, and parboil them; then stew them in broth, which, if not already
  seasoned, may be seasoned at the time the turnips are put to it. When done, skim off the fat, and
  serve in the dish with any stew or braise, or by themselves. <i>Turnips and Parsnips to Stew
  White.</i>&mdash;Parboil, cut in four, and stew them in weak broth, or milk and water (enough
  liquid to keep the turnips from burning); add salt and mace. As the liquid diminishes, put in a
  little good cream, and grated nutmeg. When done, mix with them a piece of butter rolled in
  flour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Turnip Tops.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">When they have been carefully picked, let them lie in cold water an hour. Boil in
  plenty of water, or they will taste bitter. If quite fresh and young, twenty minutes will be
  enough. Drain them on the back of a sieve.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Parsnips.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil them the same as turnips; or longer, according to their size and quality.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Carrots.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil the same as turnips; but if old, longer.&mdash;<i>Turnips</i>, <i>carrots</i>,
  and <i>parsnips</i> may be dressed together, or separately, in the following way:&mdash;Cut up 2
  or 3 onions (or less, according to the quantity of roots), and put them into a stew-pan, with a
  large piece of butter kneaded in brown flour. Shake the saucepan a few minutes over the fire, then
  put in a little broth, let it stew slowly while you prepare the roots. Scald, or parboil, turnips,
  carrots, parsnips, and celery, cut them in thin slips, and put them to the onions; season with
  salt and pepper. When done, add a little made mustard and vinegar.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: wash and
  parboil them, cut in thin slices, and put them in a saucepan with a large piece of butter, a bunch
  of parsley, sweet basil, chives, a clove of garlic, and an eschalot. Shake them over the fire, add
  a little salt, whole pepper, a blade of mace, and some flour, then put in a very little broth or
  milk and water. Stew it gently till they are tender, and the liquid reduced. Lift out the herbs,
  and put in some cream (according to the quantity required), with 2 or 3 eggs beaten up in it. Turn
  the saucepan, over the fire, till the sauce thickens. When done, add a little vinegar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beet Root and Mangel Wurzel.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash but do not scrape it, for if the skin be broken, the colour is lost. A
  middling-sized beet root will take from three to four hours to boil, and the same sized mangel
  wurzel another hour. When quite tender it is done. Serve it, cut into thin slices; thick melted
  butter poured over.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page220">{220}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Onions to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Peel and boil them till tender in milk and water. The time required must depend
  upon their size.&mdash;They may be served in white sauce. <i>Onions to Stew.</i>&mdash;Spanish
  onions are best. Peel and parboil very gently; then stew them in good broth, or milk and water,
  and season with white pepper and salt. When done, thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour,
  lift out the onions, place them in a dish, and pour the sauce over.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: stew them in
  rich, brown gravy. <i>Onions to Roast.</i>&mdash;Roast them before the fire, in their skins.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cucumbers to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare the cucumbers, and cut them in four, longways; to each one put a <i>small</i>
  onion, sliced; then stew them in broth, with cayenne, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. When done, lay
  them in a dish, thicken the sauce with butter rubbed in flour, and pour over them. For maigre
  dinners, stew them in enough water to moisten them, with a large piece of butter: when done, pour
  some cream, mixed with beaten yolk of egg, into the saucepan, enough to make a sufficiency of
  sauce, let it thicken over the fire, lay the cucumbers in a dish, and pour the sauce
  over.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: cut onions and cucumbers in halves, fry in butter, and pour good broth or
  gravy over them; then stew till done, and skim off the fat.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Celery to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the head in pieces of 3 inches long, and stew as directed for cucumbers. Some
  cooks stew it whole, or, if very large, divided in two, and in strong brown
  gravy.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: if to be white, in rich veal broth, and add some cream. It must be cooked
  till quite tender to eat well.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mushrooms and Morels.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Both are used in sauces and ragouts. For stewing, button mushrooms, or the smallest
  flaps, are best. Trim them carefully, for a little bit of mould will spoil the whole. Stew them,
  in their own gravy, in an earthen vessel, with a very little water to prevent their burning. When
  nearly done, add as much rich brown gravy as is required for <span class="pagenum"
  id="page221">{221}</span>sauce, a little nutmeg, and, if you like, finely sliced ham, cayenne,
  pepper, and salt, if required; thicken, by mixing the yolk of an egg, by little and little, into
  the gravy. If to be white, squeeze lemon juice over the mushrooms, after they have stewed in their
  own gravy: add a tea-spoonful of cream, a piece of butter rolled in flour, cayenne, white pepper,
  salt, and nutmeg; thicken with the yolk of an egg. <i>Mushrooms to Broil.</i>&mdash;The largest
  flaps are best, but should be fresh gathered. Skin them, and score the under side. Lay them, one
  by one, into an earthen vessel, brushing each one with oil, or oiled butter, and strewing a little
  pepper and salt over each. When they have steeped in this, an hour and a half, broil, on both
  sides, over a clear fire, and serve with a sauce of melted butter, minced parsley, green onions,
  and the juice of a lemon.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as carrots; and are good in soup.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Artichokes.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take off the outer leaves and cut off the stalks. Wash well in cold water, and let
  them lie in it some time. Put them head downwards, into the pot, take care to keep the water
  boiling, and add more as it diminishes, for they ought to boil two hours, or more. Float a plate
  or dish on the top to keep the artichokes under. Draw out a leaf, and if tender, they are done,
  but not else. Drain them dry, and serve melted butter, in a tureen. <i>To Fry.</i>&mdash;Cut off
  an inch or more, of the leaves, and cut the artichoke down in slices of  of an inch thick, taking
  out the choke. Parboil the slices in salt and water, then fry them in a pan nearly full of boiling
  lard, to be quite crisp, and of a fine colour. Drain them before the fire a few minutes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Trim off all the green part, wash, cut in pieces, and parboil it till about half
  done; drain well, and chop it, not very fine; put it into a stew-pan with a little strong gravy,
  and stew gently till quite tender; season with pepper and salt, and serve as sauce to roast meat
  or fricandeaus.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lettuce to Stew.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cabbage Lettuce with Forcemeat.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Parboil gently, for half an hour, then dip into cold water, and press them in your
  hand. Strip off the leaves, spread a forcemeat, rich or maigre as you please, on each
  leaf:&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put the forcemeat into the middle of each lettuce; tie them up, neatly, in
  their original shape, and stew them in gravy. When done, serve with the gravy poured over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Vegetable Marrow.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This may be boiled and served on toast, like asparagus; serve melted

  <p class="ac"><i>Marrow to Stuff</i> (<i>Italian</i>).</p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut very young ones, about six inches long, in two, lengthways; take out the seeds
  and pulp with a small spoon, put a little salt on each one, and lay them between 2 <span
  class="pagenum" id="page223">{223}</span>cloths, the hollow part down, to draw the water out. Soak
  some crumb of bread in warm broth or milk and water, beat it up like thick pap, add pepper, salt,
  the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, nutmeg and lemon peel; to this the Italians add grated parmesan; pour
  off the water, and fill the vegetable marrow with this stuffing; put the halves together, bind
  them slightly with thread, brush over beaten yolk of egg, cover with bread-crumbs, and lay them,
  singly, in a broad shallow stew-pan, well rubbed round the sides and the bottom with butter. Place
  the stew-pan over a slow fire, cover it, and when the butter is dried up, keep the marrow
  moistened with broth. When nearly cooked enough, put in some tomata sauce, and then put hot coals
  on the lid of the stew-pan to brown the vegetables. Minced fowl and grated ham may be added to the
  stuffing. <i>To Fry.</i>&mdash;Cut the long shaped ones (quite young), in four, longways, and each
  piece into long thin slices, lay these between cloths, sprinkle salt over to draw out the water,
  and let them lie half an hour: during which, prepare a smooth batter of flour, water, and 2 eggs,
  dip the marrow into it, and fry in lard, of a light brown. Shake the pan gently, but do not touch
  the fry, lest the paste should break and the fat get in, and make it greasy. Spread a sheet of
  paper on a sieve, lay the fry on it, before the fire a few minutes to dry, then serve it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cardoons.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose the whitest, and cut them into pieces of 2 inches long; half boil them in
  salt and water, with a very little vinegar; pour off the water, take out the cardoons, and peel
  off the threads; finish by stewing them, in stock of fish or meat, and butter, if required, to
  enrich it. Mix some flour with a little oil, the whites of 2 eggs, and a little white wine. Cut
  the pieces of cardoon in 2, dip them in the above mixture, and fry them in lard, of a light
  brown.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lentils</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Are chiefly used to make cullis for soups and made dishes, as follows: pick and

<hr style="width:10em"/>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">SALADS.</span></p>

  <p>Lettuce, endive, and small salading, are the most commonly used, but there are many other
  greens which eat well, as salads. They should be fresh gathered, well washed, picked, and laid in
  water with a little salt in it. When you take them out, which should not be till just before they
  are wanted, shake them well, lay them in a cloth, shake that, to make them as dry as possible, but
  do not squeeze, for that will destroy their crispness.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In countries where salad is in more general request than in England, the greatest
  pains are bestowed to have it in perfection. It is essential to a good salad, that the leaves of
  lettuces should be crisp; and the French people shake them in a basket, made for the purpose,
  which answers better than anything. The French are justly famed for their salads, but the main
  cause of their superiority in them, is attributable to the abundance and goodness of both the oil
  and the vinegar used in the mixture.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To dress Salad.</i></p>

  <p>Do not cut it up till you are going to mix it. Strew a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page225">{225}</span>little salt, and then pour over it, 3 table-spoonsful of oil to 1 of
  vinegar, add a little pepper, and stir it up well with a spoon and fork. There ought not to be a
  drop of liquid at the bottom of the bowl. To this may be added hard-boiled yolk of egg, also beet
  root well boiled and sliced. Any kind of salad may be dressed in this way. Good oil is not dear,
  but exceedingly wholesome. The least degree of the flavour of garlic is liked by some in salad,
  and may be obtained by cutting open a clove and rubbing it a few times round the salad bowl. Some
  persons like a very little grated parmesan, in their salad.</p>

  <p>Where oil is not liked, use oiled butter, or cream. Rub very smooth on a soup plate the yolks
  of hard-boiled eggs, with thick cream; when this is done, add more cream, or oiled butter,
  vinegar, pepper, and salt to your taste, and mix the salad in it: or pour the mixture into the
  bowl, the salad on the top, and do not stir it up at all, but leave this to be done at table.</p>

  <p>The top of a dressed salad should be garnished with slices of beet root, contrasted with rings
  of the white of hard-boiled eggs; or a few young radishes and green onions, or cresses, tastefully
  arranged on the top. Plovers and sea birds' eggs may be laid on the top, arranging some herb to
  form each one's nest; or all in one nest, in the centre. A pretty salad is a great ornament to a
  table, and not an expensive one.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The following list may be imperfect, but though there may be other herbs which
  would be useful in salads, all these are good.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The French make salads of cold boiled cauliflower, celery, French beans, and
  haricots. A mixture of either with <span class="pagenum" id="page226">{226}</span>some green
  herbs, dressed with oil, is very good; by way of variety.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lobster Salad.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Prepare a mixture of white lettuce, and green salading, mix it with cream or oil;
  take out the coral of the lobster, and dispose it amongst the vegetables so as best to contrast
  the colours.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: lobster may be cut up, dressed as eaten at table, then mixed with
  lettuce and small salading also cut up and dressed; the dressing of each must be according to
  taste. Some persons dress their lobster with lemon juice and cayenne. Put the mixture into a salad
  bowl, light sprigs of cresses on the top, and heaps of the coral amidst them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Italian Salad.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">About three hours before the salad is wanted, bone and chop 2 anchovies, and mix
  them in a salad bowl, with an eschalot, and some small salading, or lettuce, or any herbs, fresh
  gathered; boil 2 eggs hard, bruise the yolks, then mix them with 2 spoonsful of oil, 1 of vinegar,
  a little pepper, and a little made mustard. To this sauce, put very thin slices of cold roast meat
  of any kind, fowl, game, or lobster (and any cold gravy), and leave them to soak. Garnish it
  prettily. Cold fish may be dressed in this way; then hard-boiled eggs may be added; and, with
  either meat or fish, cold boiled vegetables. Nicely garnished, these salads are pretty for supper
  tables. Capsicums, barberries, and pickled fruit are of use in ornamenting them.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">PASTRY.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Practice</span> is more requisite than judgment to arrive at perfection in
  making pastry, particularly raised crusts, and very little can be given in the way of general
  instruction on the subject.&mdash;The flour should be of the best quality, dried before the fire,
  and then allowed to get cool before it is wetted.&mdash;Good salt butter, washed in several
  waters, to extract the salt, is cheaper in some seasons, and is as good as fresh butter. Fresh
  butter should be worked, on a board, with a wooden spoon, or the hand, to extract the butter-milk,
  before it is used for delicate pastry; after you have well worked, dab it with a soft cloth.</p>

  <p>Finely shred suet makes very good crust for fruit, as well as meat pies, and, if good, is more
  delicate and wholesome than lard; veal suet is the most delicate. Some cooks cut the suet in
  pieces, and melt it in water, then, when cold, press out the water, pound the suet in a mortar,
  with a very little oil, till it becomes the consistence of butter, and use it for pie crust; but I
  prefer fresh suet very finely <i>shred</i>, not chopped. For this purpose it must be quite
  sweet.&mdash;Lard varies much in quality; and if not good, the paste will not be light. Sweet
  marrow is very good.</p>

  <p>A marble slab is very useful for making pastry, particularly in hot weather. Pastry is never
  good made in a warm room, neither will it bear being exposed to a draught of air. The sooner it is
  baked, the lighter it will be. There is ample room for display of taste in ornamenting pastry,
  both for meat pies and sweets. Paste cutters are not expensive, and if kept in good order, will
  last a long time; but, if not delicately clean, the paste will be spoiled.</p>

  <p>For very <i>common meat pies</i>, a crust may be made of mashed potatoes, spread thickly over
  the top. For more delicate pies, rice may be boiled in milk and water till it <span
  class="pagenum" id="page228">{228}</span>begins to swell, then drained, and mixed with 1 or 2 eggs
  well beaten, and spread in a thick layer over the meat.</p>

  <p><i>A glazing</i> for meat pies is made of white sugar and water; yolk of egg and water; yolk of
  egg and melted butter.</p>

  <p><i>To ice paste</i>, beat the white of an egg, and brush it over the tart, when half baked;
  then sift finely powdered sugar over that.&mdash;<i>Another way</i>: pound and sift 4 oz. refined
  sugar, beat up the white of an egg, and by degrees add it to the sugar, till it looks white, and
  is thick; when the tarts are baked, spread the iceing over the top with a brush, and return them
  to the oven to harden, but take care that the iceing do not burn.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Be careful to keep the pasteboard and rolling-pin quite clean; and recollect that
  the best made paste will be spoiled, if not nicely <i>baked</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Plain Crust for Meat Pies.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To 2 lbs. of fine, well dried flour, put 1 lb. finely sliced fresh suet, and a
  little salt, mix it up lightly, with enough cold water to mould it, then roll out thin, fold it
  up, roll again, and it is ready. Put more suet to make it richer. <i>Another.</i>&mdash;Common
  bread dough, or French roll dough, makes very good crust for plain pies. Roll it out, and stick
  bits of butter and lard into it, and roll up again. If the dough be good the crust will be
  light.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Richer Crust.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>An Elegant Crust.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wash  lb. of very good butter, and melt it carefully, so that it do not oil, let

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page229">{229}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Flaky Crust.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Wet 1 lb. of well dried flour, with as much water as will make it into a stiff
  dough. Roll it out, and stick bits of butter over.  lb. of butter should be divided in 3, and
  rolled in at three different times.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Puff Paste.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Weigh an equal quantity of fine flour, and fresh, or well washed salt butter:
  crumble one third part of the butter into the flour, mix well together, and wet it with cold water
  to make it into dough. Dust some dry flour over the pasteboard, and work the dough well, with your
  hands, into a stiff paste; then roll out thin, and stick little bits of butter into it, sprinkle
  flour lightly over, fold the paste, roll out again; stick in more butter, fold up again, and
  repeat the same till all the butter is used. Lay a wet cloth in folds over, till you use it.
  <i>Another.</i>&mdash;Rub  lb. fresh butter into 1 lb. fine flour, with the yolks of 2 eggs
  beaten, and some finely sifted sugar: rub all together very smoothly, wet with cold water, and
  work it into a stiff paste.</p>

  as possible.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Good Light Crust.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Rub a piece of butter the size of an egg, the same of lard, and soda to lie on a
  shilling, into 1 lb. flour; mix it into a stiff paste with 1 egg and a little water; roll it out 3
  times, spread lightly, once with butter, and twice with lard.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Short Crust not Rich.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Rub into 1 lb. of flour, 6 oz. butter, 2 oz. sifted white sugar, and the yolks of 2

  class="pagenum" id="page230">{230}</span>the paste with orange or rose water, or flavour with
  lemon juice. The butter must all be crumbled into the flour before it is wetted; the less it is

  ready on the paste-board, 2 lbs. of flour, make a hole in the middle, and when the water in the
  saucepan boils, pour it into it, gently mixing it by degrees with the flour, with a spoon; when
  well mixed, knead it into a stiff paste. Dredge flour on the board, to prevent the paste from
  sticking, continue to roll, and knead it, but do not use a rolling-pin. Let it stand to cool
  before you form the crust for the pie, as follows: cut out pieces for the bottom and top, roll
  them of the proper thickness, and roll out a piece for the sides; fix the sides round the bottom
  pieces, cement them together with white of egg, and pinch the bottom crust up round to keep it
  closed firmly; then put in the meat and lay on the top crust, pinching the edges together
  closely.&mdash;It must be thick in proportion to the size of the pie.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page231">{231}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rice Paste.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix  lb. rice flour into a stiff paste with the yolk of an egg and milk, beat it
  out with a rolling-pin, and spread bits of butter over, roll it up, and spread more butter till
  you have used  lb. This will boil as well as bake.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Maccaroni Paste.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Work 1 lb. flour into a paste with 4 eggs; it will be very stiff; must be well
  kneaded, and then beaten for a long time with a rolling-pin, to make it smooth; then roll out very
  thin, and cut it in strips. This is rather toilsome than troublesome, because it is difficult to
  roll thin enough, on account of its stiffness; yet is well worth the trouble, to those who like
  maccaroni. It cooks in much less time than that which is bought, and is much more delicate.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Meat Pies.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Some cooks say that meat should be a <i>little</i> stewed with seasoning, a piece
  of butter, and only a <i>very</i> little water, before it is put into a pie.&mdash;Common meat
  pies should have a thin under crust; but the covering must be thick, or it will be scorched up,
  before the meat is cooked. Meat pies require a hot, but not a fierce oven.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Venison Pasty.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make a stiff paste of 2 lbs. of flour and 1 lb. of butter, or fresh suet shred
  finely, wet it with 4 or 5 eggs well beaten and mixed in warm water. Roll it out several times,
  line the sides of the dish, but not the bottom.&mdash;Some cooks <i>marinade</i> or <i>soak</i>
  the venison for a night, in Port wine and seasonings.&mdash;Take out all the bones, season the
  meat with salt, pepper, pounded allspice and mace, and a little cayenne, then put it into a stone
  jar, and pour over some gravy of the trimmings, or of mutton or beef; place the jar in a saucepan
  of water, and simmer it over the fire, or on a hearth two or three hours, but the meat should not
  be over done. Put it by till the next day; remove the cake of fat from the top, lay the meat in
  alternate pieces of fat <span class="pagenum" id="page232">{232}</span>and lean in a pie dish, add
  more seasoning if required, the gravy, and  pint of Port or claret; also a little eschalot or any
  flavouring vinegar. If the venison want fat, slices of mutton fat may be substituted.&mdash;The
  breast is best for a pasty, but the neck is very good; also the shoulder if too lean to roast. If
  any gravy be left have it ready to pour hot into the pasty.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Steak Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut small steaks from the rump: season, and roll up as olives, or lay them flat,
  fat and lean mixed, seasoned with salt, pepper, and spices. Then put in  pint of gravy, or  pint
  of water, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. If you have no gravy, a piece of kidney will enrich the
  gravy of the beef, and is a valuable addition to a meat pie. Forcemeat in layers between the
  slices of beef, or in small balls, makes this much richer; if to be eaten cold, suet must not be
  used: some cooks put in a few large oysters also. Walnut or mushroom catsup. A good gravy may be
  poured into the pie, when baked.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pork Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This is generally made in a raised crust, but in a common pie dish, with a plain
  crust, it is very good. Season with pepper and salt. Cut all the meat from the bones, and do not
  put any water into the pie. Pork pie is best cold, and small ones are made by laying a paste in
  saucers or small plates, then the meat; cover with paste, turning the two edges up
  neatly.&mdash;The griskin is best for pies.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sausage Rolls.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Use sausage meat; or, take equal portions of cold roast veal and ham, or cold fowl
  and tongue; chop these very small, season with a tea-spoonful of powdered sweet herbs and a
  tea-spoonful of mixed salt and cayenne: mix well together, put 3 table-spoonsful of the chopped
  and seasoned meat, well rolled together, into enough light paste to cover it, and bake half an
  hour in a brisk oven.&mdash;These may be tied in a cloth and boiled; the crust plainer.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page233">{233}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mutton Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut cutlets from the leg, or chops from the neck or loin, season with pepper and
  salt, and place them in a dish, fill this with gravy or water, and, if you choose, strew over a
  very little minced onion or eschalot and parsley, and cover with a plain crust.&mdash;<i>Squab
  Pie</i>, is made of mutton, and between each layer of meat, slices of apples, potatoes, and shred
  onions.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lamb Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as mutton pie; only being more delicate, it does not require so much
  seasoning, and is best, made to turn out of patty pans.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Veal Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut chops from the neck or breast, or cutlets from any other part, season with
  salt, pepper, mace, nutmeg, lemon peel, or what herbs you like, lay them in the dish; very thin
  slices of bacon over them; pour in a little gravy, made from the bones or trimmings, or a little
  water. Forcemeat balls, hard-boiled yolks of eggs, scalded sweetbreads, veal kidneys, truffles,
  morels, mushrooms, oysters and thick cream, may be used to enrich this pie.&mdash;<i>Or</i>:
  slices of veal, spread with forcemeat, and rolled up as olives; make a hole in the top part of the
  crust, and when it comes out of the oven, pour in some good gravy.&mdash;To be very rich: put the
  olives in a dish, and between and round them, small forcemeat balls, hard-boiled yolks of eggs,
  pickled cucumbers cut in round pieces, and pickled mushrooms; pour in good gravy, a glass of white
  wine, the juice of a lemon, or lemon and oyster pickle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Maccaroni Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Swell  lb. in broth or water; put a thick layer at the bottom of a deep dish,
  buttered all round, then a layer of beef steak cut thin, or thin slices spread with forcemeat, and
  rolled up like olives; season the beef, then another layer of maccaroni, then more beef, the top
  layer maccaroni; pour over gravy or water to fill the dish, and cover with a <i>thin</i> <span
  class="pagenum" id="page234">{234}</span>crust, and bake it. As the maccaroni absorbs the gravy,
  there ought to be more to pour in, when it comes from the oven. A light sprinkling of cheese over
  each layer of maccaroni is an improvement. This pie may be made of fowl, or veal and ham. It is
  excellent. To be eaten hot.&mdash;The <i>white chedder</i> is as good as parmesan cheese.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Calf's Head Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Clean and soak, then parboil the head for half an hour, with part of a knuckle of
  veal, or 2 shanks of mutton, in a very little water, with 2 onions, a bunch of parsley, and winter
  savory, the rind of a lemon, a few peppercorns, and 2 blades of mace. Take it up, and let it cool,
  cut it into neat pieces, skin and cut the tongue into small bits. Boil in the liquor a few chips
  of isinglass, till of a strong jelly. Spread a layer of thin slices of ham, or tongue, at the
  bottom of a dish, a layer of the head, fat and lean assorted, with forcemeat balls, hard-boiled
  yolks of eggs, and pickled mushrooms: then strew over salt, pepper, nutmeg, and grated lemon peel;
  put another layer of slices of ham, and so on, till the dish is nearly full; pour in as much of
  the jelly as there is room for, cover with a crust, and bake it. Good cold only, and will keep
  several days.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sweetbread Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil  a neck of veal and 2 lbs. gravy beef in 4 quarts of water, with  a
  tea-spoonful of grated nutmeg, and equal quantities of mace and cayenne, and a tea-spoonful of
  salt; simmer this till it is reduced to  pint, and strain it off. Put a good puff paste round
  your dish; put in 6 sweetbreads, stuffed with green truffles, and 12 oysters with their liquor
  (omit either or both, as you choose); but take care that the fish and meat are distributed; then
  fill the dish with the gravy, put on the top crust, and bake, in a quick oven, an hour and a
  quarter. To be eaten hot.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pigeon, Rook, or Moorfowl Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Season them inside with salt and pepper, and put in each a bit of butter, rolled in
  flour. (Some parboil the livers, minced with parsley, and put them inside also.) Lay a beef <span
  class="pagenum" id="page235">{235}</span>steak (some stew it first) at the bottom of the dish, or
  veal cutlets, seasoned, and thin slices of bacon; put in the pigeons, the gizzards, yolks of
  hard-boiled eggs (forcemeat balls, if you like), and enough water to make gravy. Cover with a puff
  paste, and bake it. Some cooks cut up the pigeons, and use no beef steak, as they say that the
  pigeons, if cut up, will produce a sufficiency of gravy. Port and white wine may be added; also
  catsups, sauces, and mushroom powder.&mdash;<i>Rooks</i> must be skinned; the back-bone cut
  out.&mdash;<i>Moorfowl pie</i> must not be over-baked: when done, you may pour in a hot sauce of
  melted butter, lemon juice, and a glass of claret.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hare Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut up a leveret, and season it well; to be very rich, have relishing forcemeat
  balls, and hard-boiled yolks of eggs, to mix with the meat in the dish. Put plenty of butter,
  rolled in flour, and some water, and cover with a paste. This pie will require long soaking, as
  the meat is solid; but, unless it be a leveret, much the best way is, to stew the hare first, like
  venison for pasty.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Chicken, or Rabbit Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut up the chickens, season each joint with salt, white pepper, mace, and nutmeg,
  lay them in the dish, with slices of ham or bacon, a few bits of butter, rolled in flour, and a
  little water, cover with a crust, and bake it. This pie may be made richer, by putting veal
  cutlets or veal udder, at the bottom of the dish, adding forcemeat balls and yolks of hard-boiled
  eggs; also a good jelly gravy, seasoned with peppercorns, onions, and parsley, and poured over the
  chickens before the pie is baked. Mushrooms are an improvement. Forcemeat for <i>rabbit</i> may be
  made of the livers, suet, anchovies, eschalot, onion, salt, and pepper.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Goose Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Bone, then season well, a goose, and a large fowl; stuff the fowl with the
  following forcemeat: 2 oz. grated ham, the same of veal and suet, a little parsley, salt, pepper,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page236">{236}</span>and 2 eggs to bind it. Place the fowl within the
  goose, and put that into a raised crust; fill up round with slices of tongue, or pigeons, game,
  and forcemeat; put pieces of butter, rolled in flour, over all, and cover with a crust. Bake it
  three hours.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Giblet Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stew the giblets in broth, with peppercorns, onions, and parsley. When quite
  tender, take them up, to get cold, then divide, and lay them, on a well-seasoned beef steak, in a
  pie dish, and the liquor in which they were stewed, and cover with a plain crust. When done, pour
  in a tea-cupful of cream.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Partridge, also Perigord Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Made the same as pigeon pie.&mdash;Or: instead of the steak (some use veal), at the
  bottom of the dish, spread a thick layer of forcemeat, put in the partridges, bits of butter
  rolled in flour, and a few scalded button mushrooms, or a table-spoonful of catsup. Cover with a
  good crust, and bake (if 4 partridges), an hour.&mdash;<i>Perigord Pie</i>: Singe and truss 6
  partridges, lard, season highly, and stuff them with a forcemeat made of 2 lbs. of truffles
  (brushed, washed, and peeled), the livers of the partridges, and a piece of veal udder parboiled;
  season with salt, pepper, spices, minced onion and parsley, all pounded; put a little into each
  partridge, and fill up with whole truffles; line a raised crust with thin slices of bacon and
  forcemeat, put in the partridges, cover the pie, and bake it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pheasant Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off the heads of two pheasants, bone and stuff them, with the livers,
  bread-crumbs, lemon peel, ham, veal, suet, anchovies, mace, pepper, salt, mushroom powder, and a
  little eschalot; stew them in good gravy a few minutes, then put them into a baking dish, with
  some balls of the forcemeat and pickled mushrooms; fill up with good gravy, flavoured with lemon,
  oyster, and mushroom pickle, a table-spoonful of brandy, and the same of camp sauce. <span
  class="pagenum" id="page237">{237}</span>Cover with puff paste, and bake it. Good either hot or
  cold.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sea Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut up a fowl or two, and thin slices of salt beef, the latter soaked in lukewarm
  water. Make a good paste of half flour and half mashed potatoes, with butter, lard, or dripping;
  roll out thin, put a layer at the bottom of a deep tin baking dish, then a layer of fowl and beef,
  season with pepper, salt, and a little shred onion; then another layer of paste, and one of meat,
  till the dish is nearly full, fill up with cold water, and bake it; when done, turn it out and
  serve quite hot.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: slices of bacon, and no beef.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Parsley Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This may be made of veal, fowl, or calf's feet, but the latter partly cooked first;
  scald a cullender full of fresh parsley in milk, drain it, season it with salt, pepper, and
  nutmeg, add a tea-spoonful of broth, and pour it into a pie dish, over the meat. When baked, pour
  in  pint of scalded cream.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Herb Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">One handful of spinach, and of parsley, 2 small lettuces, a very little mustard and
  cress, and a few white beet leaves; wash, then parboil them, drain, press out the water, mix with
  a little salt, cut them small, and lay them in a dish: pour over a batter of flour, 2 eggs, a pint
  of cream, and  pint of milk: cover with a rich crust and bake it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fish Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The fish should be boiled first; indeed, the remains of the previous day's dinner
  may answer the purpose. As any and every sort of fish is good in pies, one receipt will do for
  all, leaving it to the taste of the cook to enrich or flavour it.&mdash;If <i>Turbot</i>, cut the
  fish in slices, put a layer in the dish, strew over a mixture of pepper, salt, pounded mace,
  allspice, and little bits of butter, then a layer of fish, then of the seasoning and butter, till
  the dish is full. Having saved some of the liquor in which it was boiled, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page238">{238}</span>put it on to boil again, with all the skin and trimmings of the fish,
  strain and pour this into the dish for gravy. Lay a puff paste over, and bake in a slow oven half
  an hour. <i>Cod Sounds</i> must be washed well, then soak several hours, and lay them in a cloth
  to dry. Put into a stew-pan 2 oz. fresh butter, and half an onion sliced, brown these, and add a
  table-spoonful of flour rubbed into a small piece of butter, and  pint boiling water; let it boil
  up, put in about 8 cod sounds, season with pepper, the juice of a lemon, and essence of anchovies,
  stir it a few minutes over the fire, put it in a pie-dish, cover with a light paste, and bake it
  an hour.&mdash;<i>Another and richer</i>: Cut the fish into fillets; season them with pounded
  mace, pepper, cayenne, and salt; or, if whitings, eels, trout, or any fish that will admit of it,
  do not cut them up, but season the inside, and turn the fish round, fastening with a thread. Have
  some good fish stock, warm it, add seasoning, and any catsup you like. If you wish it to be
  <i>very</i> rich, line the dish with fish forcemeat, lay some bits of butter at the bottom, put a
  thick layer of the fish, then strew over chopped shrimps, prawns, or oysters, then the rest of the
  fish, strain the stock over it, enough for gravy, cover with a light puff paste, and bake it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lobster Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This is a rich compound, at its very plainest, and may be made very rich indeed.
  Parboil 1, 2, or 3, according to the size of your dish. Take out all the meat, cut it in pieces,
  and lay them in the dish, in alternate layers, with oysters cut in two, and bread-crumbs, moisten
  with essence of anchovies. Whilst you are doing this, let all the shells and the spawn of the
  lobster be stewed in half water and half vinegar: add mace and cayenne; when done, strain it; add
  wine and catsup, boil it up, and pour over the lobster. Lay a light puff paste over, and bake
  it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Herring, Eel, or Mackerel Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Skin eels, and cut them in pieces 2 inches long. Season highly, and put a little
  vinegar into the sauce. This, and all fish pies, may be baked <i>open</i>, with a paste
  edging.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page239">{239}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Shrimp and Prawn Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Having picked, put them into little shallow dishes, strew bits of butter over,
  season as you like, but allspice and chili vinegar should form a part, white wine, also 2
  anchovies, if you like. Cover with a puff paste.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Salt Fish Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Soak the fish a night. Boil it till tender, take off the skin, and take out the
  bones. If the fish be good, it will be in layers, lay them on a fish drainer to cool. Boil 5 eggs
  hard, cut them with 2 onions, and 2 potatoes in slices; put a layer at the bottom of a pie dish,
  season with pepper and made mustard, then a layer of fish, season that, another layer of the
  mixture, and so on till the dish be full; lay some bits of butter on the top, pour in a tea-cupful
  of water, with a tea-spoonful of essence of anchovy, and of catsup and oyster pickle. Cover with a
  puff paste, and bake it an hour.&mdash;The <i>sauces</i> appropriate to fish, are suitable to fish
  pies. <i>Fresh Cod Pie.</i>&mdash;Salt a piece of the middle of a fish, one night; wash, dry, and
  season it with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; lay it in a deep pie dish, with some oysters, put bits of
  butter on it, pour in some good broth, and cover with a crust. When done, pour in a  pint of hot
  cream, with a bit of butter rolled in flour, nutmeg, and grated lemon peel.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">These are convenient for a side dish at dinner, or a principal one at supper or
  luncheon. An expert cook may contrive to reserve meat or fish, when cooking a large dinner, to
  provide a dish of patties. The compound must be very nicely minced, suitably seasoned, and sent to
  table in baked paste; or fried in balls, for a garnish.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Crust for Savoury Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">If you can, get from the pastry-cook empty puff patties, it will save you trouble;
  if not, make a thin puff paste, and line the patty pans; cut out the tops, on white paper, with a
  thin stamp, and mark them neatly; put a piece of soft <span class="pagenum"
  id="page240">{240}</span>paper crumpled, in the middle of the lined patty pan, to support the top;
  put it on and bake them. Prepare the mince, and when the patties are baked enough, lift off the
  top, put the mince in (not so much as to run over the edges), and lay the top on.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Chicken, or Turkey and Ham, or Veal Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mince very finely, the breast, or other white parts of cold chicken, fowl, turkey,
  or roast veal, and about half the quantity of lean ham, or tongue. Have a little delicate gravy,
  or jelly of roast veal or lamb, thicken it with butter, rolled in flour, add pepper, salt,
  cayenne, and lemon juice; put the mince in, and stir it over the fire till quite hot, and fill the
  baked patties with this quite hot. A few oysters may be minced with the meat.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rabbit and Hare Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mince the best parts with a little mutton suet. Thicken a little good gravy, and
  season with salt, pepper, cayenne, nutmeg, mace, lemon peel, and Port wine, also the stuffing that
  may be left of the hare or rabbit; heat the mince in it, and fill patties, as above.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mince a piece of tender, underdone meat, with a little of the firm fat; season with
  salt, pepper, onion, a chopped anchovy, and a very little chili or eschalot vinegar; warm it in
  gravy, and finish, like other patties.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Oyster Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beard and wash in their own liquor, some fresh oysters; strain the liquor, and if
  of 12, put to it 1 oz. butter rolled in flour, with the oysters cut small, a little salt, white
  pepper, mace, nutmeg, and lemon peel, add to the whole 1 table-spoonful of thick cream; warm, and
  put it hot into the baked patties.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: 2 parts of oysters, prepared as above, and one
  part of fresh mushrooms, cut in dice, fried in butter, and stewed in enough gravy to moisten them;
  stir the oysters to the mushrooms, and fill the patties.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page241">{241}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lobster and Shrimp Patties.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Chop finely the meat of the tail and claws of a hen lobster; pound some of the
  spawn, with  oz. of butter, and a little meat gravy or jelly, or a table-spoonful of cream;
  season with cayenne, salt, lemon peel, and essence of anchovy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Gooseberry, or Green Currant Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Top and tail fruit enough to fill your dish; lay a strip of paste round the edge,
  put in half the fruit, then half the sugar, the rest of the fruit, more sugar, and cover with a
  good puff paste. Mark the edges neatly, and ornament the top. When it comes out of the oven, sift
  powdered sugar over.&mdash;First put a little cup in the centre of the dish, to preserve the
  juice.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rhubarb Pie.</i></p>

  <p>When old and stringy, peel the skin off, cut the stalks slantways, and make it into a pie, the
  same as gooseberry: if young, do not peel it.&mdash;Some like lemon peel in it.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Red currants, raspberries, ripe gooseberries, cherries, plums, all sorts of
  damsons, apricots, and peaches</i>, make excellent pies; allow plenty of sugar, put in a little
  cup, and fill the dish high in the middle with fruit. Divide the apricots and peaches.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Apricot Tart.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The fruit should be stewed till tender in a very little water and some sugar; baked
  in a pie dish with a covering of puff paste, and is an excellent tart.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apple Pie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Russetings, ribstone pippins, and such apples as are a little acid, are best. Pare,
  core, and slice them; sprinkle sugar between, as you put them in the dish, also a little pounded
  cinnamon and cloves. Slices of quince are an improvement, or quince marmalade, or candied citron
  or orange peel. Put a strip of paste round the edge of the dish, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page242">{242}</span>cover with a light paste. If they are dry, put in a little lemon juice,
  and a wine-glassful of white wine.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Codling Tart.</i></p>

  <p>Make the pie as directed in the last receipt, and when it comes out of the oven, with a sharp
  knife cut round the crust, an inch from the edge, take it off, and pour over the apples, a plain
  or rich custard; have ready baked on a tin, some paste leaves, and stick round the tart; or else
  cut the top, you have taken off, into lozenges, or the best shape you can, and stick them
  round.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In the country, fresh cream ought to accompany fruit pies. Clouted cream is
  excellent with fruit pies.&mdash;<i>Apples</i>, <i>gooseberries</i>, and <i>rhubarb</i> stewed,
  with sugar enough to sweeten, are better for children, than cooked in paste.&mdash;<i>Or</i>:
  fruit thus prepared, may be spread on very thin paste, covered up in turn-overs, and baked on
  tins.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cranberry Tart.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The cranberries should be stewed first, with brown sugar, and a very little water,
  then baked in open tarts, or in patty-pans lined, and covered with light puff paste.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tarts of Preserved Fruits.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cover patty-pans, or shallow tins or dishes with light puff paste, lay the preserve
  in them, cover with light bars of paste, or with paste stars, leaves, or flowers. For delicate
  preserves, the best way is to bake the paste, first, then put in the preserves, and ornament with

  <h1 class="ac" title="XX. Puddings" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER XX.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">PUDDINGS.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Practice</span>, which, generally speaking, is every thing in cooking, will
  not ensure success in making puddings, unless the ingredients be good.</p>

  <p>For pudding crust, nothing is so good as veal suet finely shred, though beef suet and beef
  marrow make light crust. Fresh dripping is also very good. Lard is not so good, for either meat or
  fruit puddings. Meat puddings (or dumplings, as they are called, in some of the counties in
  England) are generally liked, and are, either in crust or in batter, an economical dish, when made
  of the trimmings of beef or mutton, or the coarser parts of meat, which, though very good, would
  not so well admit of any other species of cooking. The meat should be quite fresh, and a due
  mixture of fat and lean. A piece of kidney, cut in bits, will enrich the gravy of beef steak or
  hare pudding. The crust for these puddings should be less rich, and thicker than for fruit
  puddings. Puddings will not be light unless the flour be fresh, and dried before the fire.</p>

  <p>The number of eggs must be regulated by their size, for a small egg is but half a large one.
  Break them separately into a tea-cup, and put them into the basin one by one; by this means you
  ascertain their freshness before you mix them together, for if one be the least stale, it will
  spoil any number with which it may be mixed. Beat them well, the two parts separately, and strain
  them to the other ingredients.</p>

  <p>Butter, whether salt or fresh, should be perfectly sweet; and milk or cream, if only a little
  upon the turn, will render of no avail all the labour that has been bestowed upon either pudding
  or custard.</p>

  <p>Let all seasoning spices be finely pounded; currants <span class="pagenum"
  id="page246">{246}</span>washed, rubbed dry, carefully picked, and laid on a sieve before the fire
  to plump; almonds must be <i>blanched</i>, namely, covered with hot water, and then peeled.</p>

  <p>Puddings of both meat and fruit may be boiled in a mould or bason, but they are lighter in a
  cloth; but then the crust must be thicker, for if it break, the gravy or juice will be lost.
  Spread the cloth in a cullender, or bason, flour it, lay in the crust, then the fruit or meat, put
  on the top, and pinch the edges firmly together, but do not let them be so thick as to form a
  heavy lump at the bottom, when the pudding is turned out.</p>

  <p>Pudding cloths should not be washed with soap, but boiled in wood ashes, rinsed in clear water,
  dried, and put by in a drawer. When about to use it, dip the cloth in boiling water, squeeze dry,
  and dredge it with flour. Do not put a pudding in the pot till the water boils fast, and let there
  be plenty of it; move the pudding from time to time for the first ten minutes; and, as the water
  diminishes, put in more, boiling hot. The water should boil <i>slowly</i>, and never for a minute
  cease to boil during the time the pudding is in. When you take it out of the pot, dip the pudding
  into cold water for an instant, and set it in a bowl or cullender, for two or three minutes; this
  will cause it to turn more easily out of the cloth.</p>

  <p>A pudding in which there is much bread should be tied up loosely, to allow it to swell. A
  batter pudding tied tight. Batter requires long beating; mix the milk and eggs by degrees into the
  flour, to avoid making it lumpy; this will be the case sometimes, and then the batter may be
  strained; but such waste may be avoided, by care in mixing at first. Tie meat puddings up
  tight.</p>

  <p>More care is necessary in baking than in boiling puddings. They should not be scorched in a too
  hot, nor made sodden, in a too cool oven.</p>

  <p class="sp3">It is an improvement to puddings, custards, and cakes, to flavour them with orange
  flower, or rose water, or any of the perfumed distilled waters.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Paste for Meat Puddings.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Shred  lb. suet and rub it into 1 lb. flour, sprinkle a little salt, and wet it
  into a stiff paste with cold water; <span class="pagenum" id="page247">{247}</span>then beat it a
  few minutes with a rolling pin. Clarified dripping is not so good, but more economical.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beef Steak Pudding.</i></p>

  <p>The more tender the steak, the better, of course, the pudding. Cut it into pieces half the size
  of your hand, season with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Spread a thin crust in a buttered
  bason, or mould; or a thicker one in a cloth: put the meat in, and a little water, also a
  wine-glassful of walnut, the same of oyster catsup, or 6 oysters, and a table-spoonful of lemon
  pickle; cover it with the top crust, fasten the edges firmly, and tie it up tightly. Finely minced
  onion may be added. A piece of kidney will enrich the gravy. A beef pudding of 2 lbs. of meat
  ought to boil <i>gently</i> four hours.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Hare, rabbit, and chicken</i>, make good puddings, the same as beef; slices of
  ham or bacon are an improvement to the two latter. Boil <i>hare pudding</i> as long as beef.
  <i>Dumplings.</i>&mdash;Chop beef small, season well, and put it into dumplings, the same as apple
  dumplings, and boil one hour.&mdash;<i>Sausage</i> meat, or whole sausages, skinned, may be boiled
  in paste, and are very good.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Suet Pudding and Dumplings.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Chop 6 oz. suet very fine, put it into a basin with 6 oz. flour, 2 oz.
  bread-crumbs, and a tea-spoonful of salt, stir well together, and pour in, by degrees, enough
  milk, or milk and water, to make it into a light pudding; put it into a floured cloth, and boil
  two hours. For dumplings, mix the above stiffer, make it into 6 dumplings, and tie them separately
  in a cloth; boil them one hour. 1 or 2 eggs are an improvement. 6 oz. of currants to the above
  quantity, make <i>currant dumplings</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Meat in Batter.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the meat into chops or steaks, put them in a deep dish, season with pepper and
  salt, and fill up the dish with a batter, made of three eggs, and 4 large table-spoonsful of
  flour, to a pint of milk; then bake it.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: bake the meat <span class="pagenum"
  id="page248">{248}</span>whole, and if a large piece, let it be in the oven half an hour before
  you pour in the batter, or else they will be cooked unequally.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Kidney Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Split and soak 1 or 2 ox kidneys, and season well; line a bason or cloth with a
  crust, put them in, and boil it two hours and a half; rather less, if in a cloth.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fish Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pound some slices of whiting in a mortar, with  lb. butter; soak slices of 2
  French rolls in cold milk, beat them up with pepper and salt, and mix with the fish. Boil this, in
  a buttered bason, about an hour and a half. Serve melted butter.&mdash;<i>Mackerel</i> is made
  into puddings; for this follow the directions for beef steak pudding.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Black Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">They are made of hog's blood. Salt, strain, and boil it <i>very slowly</i>, or it
  will curdle, with a little milk or broth, pepper, salt, and minced onion; stir in, by degrees,
  some dried oatmeal and sliced suet; add what savoury herbs you like, fill the skins, and boil
  them. Some put in whole rice or grits (parboiled), in place of oatmeal.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hog's Puddings, White.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix  lb. almonds blanched and cut in pieces, with 1 lb. grated bread, 2 lbs. beef
  or mutton suet, 1 lb. currants, some cinnamon and mace, a pint of cream, the yolks of 5 and whites
  of 2 eggs, some Lisbon sugar, lemon peel, and citron sliced, and a little orange-flower water.
  Fill the skins rather more than half, and boil in milk and water.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apple Pudding to Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make a paste in the proportion of 4 oz. suet, or 2 oz. butter, lard, or dripping,
  to 8 oz. flour, and a little salt. Some use an egg or two, others cold water only, but it should
  be a <i>stiff</i> paste. Line a mould, bason, or cloth, with this paste, rolled smooth, put in the
  apples, pared, <span class="pagenum" id="page249">{249}</span>cored, and sliced; sweeten with
  brown sugar, and flavour with cloves, cinnamon, or lemon peel, as you like. Some persons put in 3
  or 4 cloves, or a small piece of cinnamon, also lemon peel.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Apricot Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as the last, and is delicious. Let the crust be delicate, and use white
  powdered sugar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Roll Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Roll out a paste as directed for apple pudding, spread jam or any other preserve
  you like on it, roll it over, tie it in a cloth, and boil it.&mdash;A very nice mixture to spread
  over paste in place of preserves, is composed of apples, currants, and a very little of mace,
  cinnamon, and sugar. <i>Another Jam Pudding</i>: line a bason with a thin paste, spread a layer of
  preserve at the bottom, then a thin paste to cover it, then a layer of preserve, and so on, till
  the bason is filled, cover with paste, pinch it round the edges, and boil it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apple Dumplings.</i></p>

  <p>Peel large apples, divide them, take out the cores, then close them again, first putting 1
  clove in each. Roll out thin paste, cut it into as many pieces as you have apples, and fold each
  one neatly up; close the paste safely. Tie up each dumpling separately, very tight, and boil them
  an hour. When you take them up, dip each one into cold water, stand it in a bason two or three
  minutes, and it will turn more easily out of the cloth.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>Green currants</i>, <i>ripe currants</i>, <i>and raspberries</i>,
  <i>gooseberries</i>, <i>cherries</i>, <i>damsons</i>, and all the various sorts of <i>plums</i>,
  are made into puddings, the same as <i>apple pudding</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Plum Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">For this national compound there are many receipts, and rich plum puddings are all
  very much alike, but the following receipts are very good:&mdash;To 6 oz. finely shred beef <span
  class="pagenum" id="page250">{250}</span>suet, add 2 oz. flour, 4 oz. stoned raisins, 4 oz. well
  picked and plumped currants, pounded allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar to taste, and a
  tea-spoonsful of salt; mix these ingredients well, and wet them with 3 eggs well beaten, and as
  much milk as is required to mix it into a rather stiff pudding. You may add a wine-glassful of
  brandy, or 2 of sweet white wine; indeed, brandy is rarely omitted; some prefer the flavour of
  orange flower or rose-water. This pudding may be made richer by the addition of 1 oz. candied
  lemon peel, and  oz. citron. It should boil at least four hours.&mdash;<i>Or</i>:  lb. of slices
  of stale bread, pour  pint of boiling milk over, and cover close for fifteen or twenty minutes;
  beat this up with  lb. suet,  lb. raisins, and the same of currants, all chopped fine; add 2
  table-spoonsful of flour, 3 eggs, a little salt, and as much milk as is required. This may be
  either boiled or baked.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: to  lb. currants,  lb. raisins, and  lb. suet, add 
  lb. bread-crumbs, 6 eggs, a wine-glassful of brandy,  a tea-cupful of fine sugar,  a nutmeg
  grated, and as much candied orange or lemon peel as you like: mix well, and boil three hours. No
  other liquid is required.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Christmas Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To 1 lb. suet add 1 lb. flour, 1 lb. raisins, 1 lb. currants (chopped fine), 4 oz.
  bread-crumbs, 2 table-spoonsful sugar, 1 of grated lemon peel, a blade of mace,  a nutmeg, a

  <p class="ac"><i>Marrow Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pour a quart of boiling milk over a large breakfast-cupful of stale crumbs, and
  cover a plate over. Shred  lb. fresh marrow, mix with it 2 oz. raisins, 2 oz. currants, and beat
  them up with the soaked bread; sweeten to your taste, add a tea-spoonful of cinnamon powder, and a
  very little nutmeg. Lay a puff paste round the edge of a shallow pudding dish, and pour the
  pudding in. Bake from twenty-five minutes to half an hour. You may add lemon peel, a wine-glassful
  of brandy, some almonds blanched and slit; also candied citron and lemon peel.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page251">{251}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Sauce for Plum Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Melt good fresh butter, thicken it, and stir in by degrees, a wine-glassful of
  white wine, the same of brandy or old rum; sweeten to your taste, and add grated lemon peel and
  cinnamon. <i>A Store Pudding Sauce.</i>&mdash;To  pint brandy, and 1 pint sherry, add 1 oz.
  thinly pared lemon peel, and  oz. mace; infuse these two or three weeks, then strain and bottle
  it. Add as much as you like to thick melted butter, and sweeten to taste.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>French Plum Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix 6 oz. suet, 7 oz. grated bread, 2 oz. sugar, 3 eggs, a coffee-cupful of milk, a

  <p class="ac"><i>Maigre Plum Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Simmer in  pint milk, 2 blades mace, and a bit of lemon peel, for ten minutes;
  strain into a basin, to cool. Beat 3 eggs, with 3 oz. lump sugar,  of a nutmeg grated, and 3 oz.
  flour; beat well together, and add the milk by degrees; then put in 3 oz. fresh butter, 2 or 3 oz.

  <p class="ac"><i>Custard Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil a stick of cinnamon and a roll of lemon peel, in a pint of new milk, or cream,

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page253">{253}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Little Puddings.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Grate a penny loaf, and mix well with a handful of currants, a very little fresh
  butter, nutmeg, and the yolk of an egg; make it into little balls, flour them, tie separately in a
  cloth, and boil them half an hour. Serve quite hot, with wine sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>An Excellent Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil a bit of cinnamon in a pint of milk, pour it over thin slices of French roll,
  or an equal quantity of rusks, cover with a plate to cool; beat it quite smooth with 6 oz. shred
  suet,  lb. currants, 3 eggs beaten, and a little brandy, old rum, or orange-flower water. Bake an
  hour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Oatmeal Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Steep the oatmeal all night in milk. Pour off the milk, and stir into the meal some
  cream, currants, spice, sugar, or salt, to your taste, and 3 or 4 eggs; or, if no cream, use more
  eggs. Stir well, and boil it in a basin an hour. Pour melted butter, sweetened, over it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Batter Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beat 4 eggs and mix them smoothly, with 4 table-spoonsful of flour, then stir in by
  degrees, 1 pint of new milk, beat it well, add a tea-spoonful of salt, and boil in a mould an
  hour, or bake it half an hour.&mdash;<i>Black Cap Pudding</i> is made in the same way, with the
  addition of 3 oz. currants; these will fall to the bottom of the basin, and form a black cap when
  the pudding is turned out.&mdash;<i>Batter Pudding with Fruit</i> is made as follows: pare, core,
  and divide, 8 large apples, put them in a deep pudding dish, pour a batter over, and bake
  it.&mdash;Cherries, plums, damsons, and most sorts of fruit, make nice puddings in this
  way.&mdash;Serve sweet sauce with batter puddings.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: raspberry vinegar, such as is
  made at home, clear, and possessing the flavour of the fruit.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Yorkshire Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This is batter, the same as the last receipt, baked, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page254">{254}</span>eaten with roast meat; but in some houses it is not baked, but cooked
  under the meat thus: pour it into a shallow tin pan, put it under roasting meat, and stir till it
  begins to settle. After one or two trials a cook will know when to put the pudding under the meat,
  for that must depend upon the size of the joint, as it ought to go to table as soon as it is done,
  or it will be heavy. They are much lighter not turned. The fat will require to be poured off, once
  or twice.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Potato Puddings.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil in a quart of milk, a bit of lemon peel, and some nutmeg. Rub smooth, in a
  little cold milk, 4 table-spoonsful of potato flour, and stir it, by degrees, into the hot milk;

  Add brandy or orange-flower water.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Carrot Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix  lb. grated raw carrot with  lb. grated bread, and stir these into a pint of
  thick cream and the yolks of 8 eggs well beaten, then stir in  lb. fresh butter, melted, 3
  spoonsful of orange-flower water,  a wine-glassful of brandy, a nutmeg grated, and sugar to your
  taste; stir all well together, and if too thick, add a very little new milk, pour it into a dish
  lined with paste and bake it an hour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hasty Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beat the yolk of an egg into  pint new milk with a little salt, stir this by
  degrees into 3 table-spoonsful of flour, and beat it to a smooth batter. Set 1 pint of milk on
  the fire; when scalding hot pour in the batter, keep stirring that it may be smooth and not burn:
  let it thicken, but not boil. Serve it directly.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Buttermilk Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Use fresh buttermilk, and make the same as batter pudding, but without eggs. This
  is very good, with roast meat.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: warm 3 quarts of milk with a quart of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page255">{255}</span>buttermilk, then pour it through a sieve; when the curd
  is dry, pound it with  lb. sugar, the peel of a lemon boiled till tender, the crumb of a roll, 6
  bitter almonds, 4 oz. butter, the yolks of 5 and whites of 3 eggs, a tea-cupful of good cream, a

  nutmeg, ginger, and lemon peel; put it into a buttered dish, and strew over the top 2 oz. shred
  suet, or butter. Bake or boil it three quarters of an hour. <i>Currants</i> or <i>raisins</i> are
  an improvement.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Camp Puddings.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Melt  lb. butter in  pint of water, with a little salt, sugar to your taste, and

  <p class="ac"><i>Nursery Pudding.</i></p>

  it by degrees, stirring all the <span class="pagenum" id="page256">{256}</span>time, a pint of

  <p class="ac"><i>Ground Rice Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix 2 oz. ground rice with  pint of cold milk; scald 1 pint of new milk, and pour
  the rice and milk into it, stirring over the fire till it thickens: let it cool, then add 5 eggs
  well beaten, 6 oz. of powdered sugar, nutmeg, and a spoonful of orange-flower water, stir all well
  together, and bake in a dish, with a paste border, half an hour. Currants may be added. It may be
  boiled in a mould, an hour. Indian corn flour makes good puddings the same way; and there are
  preparations of Indian corn, such as <i>soujie</i>, <i>semolina</i>, and <i>golden polenta</i>,
  which may be dressed in the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Semolina Pudding.</i></p>

  half an hour.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Indian Corn Mush.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same thing as oatmeal porridge, but made of Indian corn meal. Boil 2 quarts of
  water with a little salt, and mix it, by degrees, into 1 lb. corn meal; boil very gently three
  quarters of an hour, stirring all the time, that the meal may not adhere to the bottom of the
  saucepan, and burn.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Hommony.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil one third of a pound of Indian meal in water to cover it, for twenty minutes,
  or until nearly all the water is wasted; it must be like thick paste. Put a piece of butter the
  size of a walnut into a vegetable dish, pour in the hommony, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page257">{257}</span>and serve it, like mashed turnips. Dip your spoon in the middle when you
  help it. In some parts of America, what they call <i>hommony</i> is made of the <i>cracked</i>
  corn: and if so, it must be something of the same kind as our peas-pudding, but not boiled in a
  cloth.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Polenta.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The best thing to prepare this in, is a three legged iron pot, hung over the fire.
  Let the fire be hot, and also blazing, if possible. To a quart of water, when it boils, put in a
  little salt, then add 12 oz. of meal, but be careful to do it in the following manner: while the
  water is boiling stir in half the meal first, but be sure to stir quickly all the time, or it may
  be lumpy, then you may put in the remainder at once, but keep stirring constantly. When it has
  been on the fire a quarter of an hour, cease to stir, take the pot off the fire and set it on the
  floor for two minutes, then put it on the fire again, and you will see the polenta first rise in a
  great puff, then break and fall; as soon as you perceive this, take it off the fire, and turn it
  out into a dish; it ought to come out quite clean, not leaving a particle adhering to the pot,
  else there has been some fault in the boiling. It is stirred with a long stick, thicker at one end
  than the other. Of this the Italians make an endless variety of dishes, some of which are the
  following: the most simple mode of dressing the polenta is thus: pour it from the boiling into a
  bowl, when cold turn it out; take a coarse thread in your two hands, put it on the side of the
  polenta away from you, draw the thread towards you, and you will find that it cuts a clean slice
  of polenta off, continue till you have cut it all into slices, and then you may dress them in
  different ways: the commonest is to cut the slices <i>thick</i> and brown them on a gridiron.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Whole Rice Pudding.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pancakes.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The batter requires long beating, but the great art consists in frying them. The

  little salt, into 3 table-spoonsful of flour, or allow an egg to each spoonful of flour, add
  pounded cinnamon, and, by degrees, a pint of new milk, and beat it to a smooth batter. Make a

  out and wipe the pan; put a piece more in, and when it has melted and begins to froth, pour in a
  ladle or tea-cupful of the batter, toss the pan round, run a knife round the edges, and turn the
  pancake when the top is of a light brown; brown the other side; roll it up, and serve very hot.
  Currant jelly, or marmalade, may be spread thinly on the pancake before it is rolled up. Cream and
  more eggs will make it richer; also brandy or lemon juice.</p>

  lard; fry as many at a time as the pan will hold. Sift powdered sugar over, and serve on a hot
  dish. Fritters are usually made with minced apple or currants, stirred into the batter, or any
  sweetmeat stiff enough to be cut into little bits, or candied lemon or orange <span
  class="pagenum" id="page267">{267}</span>peel.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: grate the crumb of a stale roll,
  beat it smooth in a pint of milk over the fire, then let it get cold, and mix it with the yolks of
  5 eggs, 3 oz. sifted sugar, and  a nutmeg. Fry in boiling lard, and serve hot. Sweet sauce in a
  tureen. <i>Curd Fritters</i>&mdash;Rub a quart basin full of dried curd with the yolks of 8 and
  whites of 4 eggs; 3 oz. sugar,  a nutmeg grated, and a dessert-spoonful of flour; beat well, and
  drop the batter into boiling lard. <i>Apple Fritters</i>&mdash;Make a stiff common pancake batter.
  Boil  a stick of cinnamon in a breakfast-cupful of water, and let it cool. Peel and core some
  large apples, cut them in round slices, and steep them half an hour, or more, in the cinnamon
  water; then dip each piece in the batter, and fry them in lard, or clarified dripping. Drain, dust
  sugar over each one, and serve hot.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: to make a pretty dish, drop enough batter
  into the pan to form a fritter the size of the slices of apple, lay a slice of apple upon that,
  and drop batter on the top.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: the apples may be pared, cored, half baked (whole),
  then dipped in the batter, and fried.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Rice White Pot.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 1 lb. whole rice quite tender, in 2 quarts of new milk, strain, and beat it in
  a mortar with  lb. blanched almonds, and a little rose water. Boil 2 quarts of cream with a blade
  or 2 of mace, let it cool, and stir into it 5 eggs well beaten, sweeten to taste, pour it into the
  rice, mix well, and bake half an hour. Lay some slices of candied orange and citron on the top
  before you put it into the oven.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: to a quart of new milk add the yolks of 4 and
  the whites of 2 eggs, a table-spoonful of rose water, and 2 oz. sugar; beat well, and pour it into
  a pie dish, over some thin slices of bread: bake it half an hour.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Almost</span> every county has its peculiar fashion of making bread: and
  almost every hand differs in the practice. The receipt here given is the one followed by most
  persons in Hampshire; and I select it, being the one I am most familiar with, and not because that
  county is famed for excellence in bread; for much depends upon the goodness of the flour, and some
  other parts of England excel Hampshire in this respect.</p>

  <p>Good bread is so essential, that no pains ought to be spared to procure it. For this purpose
  the flour ought to be well prepared, and kept in a dry place. Some persons like brown bread, but
  it is not, in general, so wholesome as that which is all white. Six pounds of rye flour, to a peck
  of wheaten flour, makes very good bread.</p>

  <p>The advantages of making bread <i>at home</i>, in preference to buying it at the baker's, are
  stated in <span class="sc">Cobbett's</span> "<span class="sc">Cottage Economy</span>"; and I refer
  my readers to that little work, to convince them that they will benefit greatly by following the
  advice there given on this subject.</p>

  <p>Small beer yeast is the best for making bread, as ale, or strong beer yeast, is generally too
  bitter.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>To take the Bitter from Yeast.</i>&mdash;Put the yeast to the water you use to
  mix the "batter," or as the country people call it, "set the sponge," and stir into it 2 or 3 good
  handfuls of bran; pour it through a sieve or jelly bag (kept for the purpose), and then mix it
  into the flour. The bran not only corrects the bitterness of the yeast, but communicates a
  sweetness to the bread.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put into the yeast 2 or 3 pieces of wood coal, stir them
  about, pour the water in, and then strain it.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page269">{269}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Household Bread.</i></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">(From Cobbett's Cottage Economy.)</span></p>

  <p>"Supposing the quantity to be a bushel of flour, put it into the trough, and make a deep hole
  in the middle. Stir into a pint (or if very thick and good,  or  pint), of yeast, a pint of soft
  warm water, and pour it into the hole in the flour. In very cold weather the water should be
  nearly hot, in very warm weather only lukewarm. Take a spoon and work it round the outside of this
  body of moisture, so as to bring into that body, by degrees, flour enough to form a <i>thin
  batter</i>, which you must stir about well for a minute or two. Then take a handful of flour and
  scatter it thinly over the head of this batter, so as to <i>hide</i> it. Cover a cloth over the
  trough to keep the air from the bread, and the thickness of this covering, as well as the
  situation of the trough as to distance from the fire, must depend on the nature of the place and
  state of the weather, as to heat and cold. When you perceive that the batter has risen enough to
  make <i>cracks</i> in the flour that you covered it over with, you begin to form the whole mass
  into <i>dough</i>, thus: you begin round the hole containing the batter, working the flour into
  the batter, and pouring in, as it is wanted, soft water, or half milk and half water, in winter a
  <i>little</i> warm, in summer quite cold; but before you begin this, you scatter the salt over the
  heap, at the rate of a lb. to a bushel of flour. When you have got the whole <i>sufficiently
  moist</i>, you <i>knead it well</i>. This is a grand part of the business; for unless the dough be
  <i>well worked</i>, there will be <i>little round lumps of flour in the loaves</i>; besides which,
  the original batter, which is to give fermentation to the whole, will not be duly mixed. The dough
  must, therefore, be well worked. The <i>fists</i> must go heartily into it. It must be rolled
  over; pressed out; folded up, and pressed out again, until it be completely mixed, and formed into
  a <i>stiff</i> and <i>tough dough</i>."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The loaves are made up according to fancy, both as to size and shape; but the time
  they require to bake will greatly depend upon the former, for the household loaf of a Hampshire
  farm-house takes three hours or three hours and a half, while that of a Norfolk farm-house does
  not, I should imagine, require half the time.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page270">{270}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>French Bread or Rolls.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Warm 1 pint of milk, add  pint yeast; mix them with fine flour to a thick batter,
  put it near the fire to rise, keeping it covered. When it has risen as high as it will, add  pint
  of warm water,  oz. salt, 2 oz. butter; rub the butter first with a little dry flour, mix the
  dough not quite so stiff as for common bread; let it stand three quarters of an hour to rise, then
  make it into rolls. Bake in a quick oven.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rice Bread.</i></p>

  <p>To  lb. wheat flour, allow 1 lb. rice; the latter first boiled in four times its weight of
  water, till it becomes a perfect pulp, then mix by degrees, the flour with the rice, and
  sufficient yeast for the quantity of bread; knead and set it to rise.</p>

  <p>It was the fashion in this country to present a variety of cakes, some hot and some cold, on
  the tea-table; but now, except in some of the northern counties, the good custom is obsolete.</p>

  <p>In America, it is the general custom to dine early, to take tea rather late, and no supper; and
  there the tea table is a matter of as much consideration as the dinner table is in England or
  France. Every house in America, especially in the country, has one, two, or more cottage ovens of
  various sizes. I believe that these very useful things are known in some parts of England, but I
  never saw them except in America. They are particularly adapted to open fire-places, where wood or
  peat are burnt. They are much the same as the iron pots, which stand on legs, except that the
  bottom of the oven is flat, not round, and that the lid fits into the top, leaving a space
  sufficient to hold a layer of hot coals: the oven stands upon legs, at a little distance from the
  ground, to admit of hot coals being placed under it. A loaf the size of our quartern loaf may be
  baked in this way, as well as tarts, cakes, custards, apples, pears, &amp;c., &amp;c. By means of
  this little oven, much labour and fuel are saved. Another appendage to an American kitchen, is the
  <i>girdle</i> for baking many sorts of cakes, and crumpets; and on this girdle they cook their
  far-famed buckwheat cakes. It is a round iron plate with a handle over it, which is hung upon the
  crane upon which <span class="pagenum" id="page271">{271}</span>iron pots are hung, or it will
  stand upon a trivet, and then the crumpets are cooked in the same way as pancakes; and are much
  better thus, fresh made, than as they are generally eaten.</p>

  <p>In the country, where eggs, cream, and flour (the chief ingredients), are always to be obtained
  in perfection, there is no excuse for an absence of cakes for the tea, or of rolls at the
  breakfast table. In most houses, there are young ladies who might attend to this department, with
  very little loss of time, and with much credit to themselves, and I should be glad if I saw reason
  to hope that those who are now growing up would not despise the practice. The more difficult and
  intricate articles of ornamental confectionary, may be too troublesome for any but professors of
  the art; but all <i>cakes</i> may be made at home. Nothing worth knowing, is to be learned without
  trouble; but in the art of making and baking cakes, few failures can arise after any number of
  trials.</p>

  <p>Flour for cakes should be of the best quality, well dried, and sifted. The eggs fresh, beaten
  separately, and beaten well. Currants well washed, picked, and dried in a cloth, or before the
  fire. The ingredients thoroughly mixed, and the cake put into the oven <i>instantly</i>, unless
  there be yeast, and then time must be given for it to rise.</p>

  <p>Sal Volatile is used, not to make cakes rise, but to prevent their flattening, after they have
  risen, but though the practice may not be injurious, it had better be avoided. Yeast ought to be
  sweet, white, and thick; and may be prepared in the manner directed for bread. Pearl-ash is
  sometimes used to lighten bread and cakes.</p>

  <p>An iceing is made as follows: to  lb. finely sifted sugar put the whites of 2 eggs, beaten
  with a little water; beat all well with a whisk till quite smooth, and spread it thickly over the
  cake, with a spoon; for small cakes, put it on lightly, with a brush.</p>

  <p>Ovens vary so much, that experience alone can teach what quantity of fuel, and what portion of
  time may be required to heat any particular one. When such knowledge is once obtained, it will be
  a matter of no great difficulty so to manage the oven that it be always of the right temperature;
  which it must be, or all labour is lost.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">CONFECTIONARY.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">As I should always have recourse to the confectioner for all ornamental dishes, I
  shall give under this head, only such things as may be prepared at home with comparatively little
  risk of failure, and consequent waste of materials; observing, at the same time, that the plainest
  custard requires as much attention as the richest cream, and that all sweet dishes require to be
  flavoured with judgment. It is impossible to produce delicate creams, jellies, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
  unless the ingredients, particularly cream, milk, and eggs, be perfectly fresh, and unless there
  be <i>enough</i> of them. If served in glasses or dishes, use only eggs; but, if the cream is to
  be turned out of a shape, isinglass must be used to stiffen it. The quantity greatly depends upon
  the size of the shape; 1 oz. to a pint is the general allowance, but more is often
  necessary.&mdash;The sugar used in jellies ought to be clarified, for one point of excellence is
  clearness.&mdash;To prevent oiling, put a little rose water into the mortar in which you pound
  almonds.&mdash;Where there is much practice in making sweet dishes, all the vessels should be kept
  wholly for that purpose. Jelly bags and sieves delicately clean, always dipped into, and wrung out
  of, hot water, before they are used.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Common Custards.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To  pint new milk, put a little piece of lemon peel cut <span class="pagenum"
  id="page284">{284}</span>very thin, a little cinnamon, and 8 bitter almonds blanched and pounded.
  Simmer the milk ten minutes. Then strain, and when cool, put to it a pint of cream, the yolks of 5
  eggs, 2 table-spoonsful sifted sugar, and set it in a saucepan over the fire. Stir one way, all
  the time; take care that it do not burn, and not boil. When thick enough it will be done, and a
  minute or two too much will cause it to turn. When taken from the fire, add half a glass of
  brandy, and stir a quarter of an hour before you pour it into cups. In case of no cream, use 3
  more eggs.&mdash;<i>Or:</i> mix a table-spoonful of rice flour in a little cold milk, and add the
  beaten yolks of 6 eggs. Have ready boiled, a quart of new milk, with a bit of lemon peel, and
  cinnamon; let it cool, then stir the eggs and some sugar into it: let it thicken over the fire,
  but not boil, stirring all the time. Take it off the fire, pour it into a jug, and stir till cool.
  Serve in cups, or a glass dish, and grate nutmeg over. Some persons boil custards in a jug, set
  into a deep saucepan of water, which is kept boiling.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rich Custards to Bake, or Boil.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil a quart of cream with mace and cinnamon. Take it off the fire, add sugar to
  taste, and let it stand till no warmer than milk from the cow; then add 10 eggs, well beaten.
  Strain it, and fill the cups very full. The oven must be as hot as for tarts, and the cups often
  turned; or finish by boiling them in a jug stood in boiling water, but keep stirring all the
  while. Brandy is an improvement, in the proportion of a wine-glassful to a quart. Some flavour
  with ratafia, peach water, or orange flower water. A dessert-spoonful of isinglass will add to the
  firmness of custards made entirely of milk.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lemon Custards.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Beat the yolks of 8 eggs till they are as white as milk, add the grated rinds and
  juice of 2 lemons, sweeten to taste; pour in a pint of boiling water and stir over the fire till
  it thickens, add a wine-glassful of white wine, and the same of brandy, stir over the fire again

  well, a quarter of an hour, and pour in, by degrees, a pint of boiling cream; keep on beating till
  cold, then pour it into cups, and set them in a deep dish in boiling water, till very thick.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Spanish Custards.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Set 1 pint of thin cream over the fire, leaving out a tea-cupful; put in 6 or 8
  bitter almonds, and  oz. isinglass dissolved in a basin with boiling water enough to cover it;
  simmer for three-quarters of an hour, or till the isinglass is dissolved; mix smoothly into the
  cold cream a table-spoonful of ground rice, pour it into the hot cream, stirring all the time, and
  simmer it gently till it thickens sufficiently. Flavour with 2 table-spoonsful of orange flower,
  or rose water, or what you like; strain through a coarse hair sieve, and stir till nearly cold,
  when pour it into cups dipped in cold water. Let these stand in a cool place; when firm, turn them
  out on a dish, stick them with blanched almonds sliced, and garnish with preserved cucumber,
  citron, or other preserve; when about to serve, pour a little cold cream into the
  dish.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: boil a pint of cream with a stick of cinnamon, let it cool, strain it, add
  3 table-spoonsful of rice flour, the whites of 3 eggs well beaten, sugar, and a little rose water;
  set it over the fire, and simmer till as thick as hasty pudding; wet a mould with rose water, pour
  the custard in; when cold, turn it out.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Custards with Apples.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare, core, and either stew or bake some apples, in an earthen pan, with as little
  water as possible, and sugar to sweeten. When they are fallen, put them into a pie dish, and let
  them stand to get cold; pour over an unboiled custard, and set the dish into the oven, or before
  the fire, until the custard is fixed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page286">{286}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Custard with Rice.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil some rice in milk till quite tender, with cinnamon and a very few bitter
  almonds; when cold, sweeten it, and form a thick high wall round a glass dish, and pour a boiled
  custard in the centre. Just before it goes to table, strew coloured comfits, in stripes, up the
  wall.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Trifle.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Whisk a quart of good cream with 6 oz. powdered sugar, a glass of white wine, the
  juice and grated peel of 1 lemon, and a little cinnamon. Take off the froth as it rises, and lay
  it on a sieve, reversed, over a bowl. This should be done early in the morning, or the day before,
  that the froth may be firm. Place in a deep trifle dish 3 or 4 sponge cakes, some maccaroons, and
  ratafia cakes, also a few sweet almonds blanched and split, then pour over enough white wine, with
  a little brandy, to moisten them; when the wine is soaked up, spread over the cakes a layer of
  raspberry jam, or any good preserve, and pour over that a <i>rich</i> and boiled custard. Heap the
  whip lightly on as high as the dish will allow. The preserve used or left out, according to
  taste.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Gooseberry or Apple Trifle.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scald the fruit, and pulp it through a sieve, sweeten it, and put a thick layer in
  a glass dish. Mix  pint of milk,  pint of cream, and the yolk of 1 egg, scald it over the fire,
  stirring all the time, add sugar, and let it become cold, then lay it on the fruit, and on it a
  whip, as directed in the last receipt.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: scald, pulp, and sweeten the fruit, then
  stir it over the fire, into a thin custard: when cooked enough, pour it into a glass dish, to get
  cold. If apple, grate nutmeg and cinnamon, or lemon peel, over the top, add also lemon juice, and
  lay a whip on the top.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>A Tipsy Cake.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put a stale sponge cake into a deep china or glass dish, pour round it some raisin
  wine or Marsala, and brandy to your taste, but enough to saturate the cake: when it is <span
  class="pagenum" id="page287">{287}</span>soaked up, strew sifted sugar over, and pour in the dish
  a rich custard. Ornament the top of the cake by sticking a light flower in the centre, or bits of
  clear currant jelly; <i>or</i>, sweet almonds blanched and split.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Crme Patisserie.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil a quart of new milk with cinnamon and lemon peel. Rub a heaped table-spoonful
  of flour quite smooth with a little cold milk; stir the boiled milk, by degrees, into it; add 5
  eggs, and sugar to taste. Stir it over a slow fire till it thickens; pour it into a dish, and stir
  it slowly a few minutes. Flavour with vanilla, orange-flower water, ratafia, or brandy. This is
  flavoured with <i>tea</i> or <i>coffee</i>, in the following manner: put a heaped table-spoonful
  of green tea into the milk, boil it up, cover the saucepan, simmer it a few minutes, then strain
  it. This will give a strong flavour of tea. For coffee: make a breakfast-cupful of very strong
  coffee, and put it into the milk just before it boils: use no other flavouring ingredient, and
  sweeten the cream sufficiently.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: boil in a pint of thin cream, the peel of a large
  lemon grated or pared very thin, sugar to taste, and a very small piece of cinnamon. Work up a
  table-spoonful of flour with the juice of the lemon; pour the boiling cream to it, by degrees, and

  <p class="ac"><i>Italian Cream.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 1 pint of sweet cream with  pint of new milk, the rind of a lemon cut thin,
  and sugar to taste; then let it cool. Beat the yolks of 8 eggs, add them to the cream, set it over
  the fire, stir till it thickens, and put in about 1 oz. of melted isinglass, to stiffen it. Whisk
  well, and strain it through a fine sieve into a mould, to turn out. First try a little in a saucer

  <p class="sp5"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Those who like to use <i>Gelatine</i> will find directions with
  the packets, when they buy it. It is useful as a means of taking wine and brandy in the form of
  jelly, and is quickly prepared, but has little else to recommend it.</p>

  <h1 class="ac" title="XXIII. Preserves" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER XXIII.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">PRESERVES.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Fruit</span> for every sort of preserve, ought to be the best of its kind;
  ripe enough, but not over ripe; gathered <i>on</i> a dry day, and <i>after</i> a dry day. The
  sugar of the best quality, and plenty of it, otherwise they are not good, neither will they keep;
  and much is wasted by boiling up a second time. Long boiling injures the colour of preserves, and
  they <i>must</i> be boiled too long, if there be not sugar enough. The bags and sieves should be
  kept delicately clean; wring them out of hot water the moment before you use them. Do not squeeze
  the bag, or press the fruit much, or the jelly will not be clear; this is not wasteful, for the
  fruit which is left, and a little fresh added to it, will make jam, or black butter; a very useful
  preserve. In boiling jams, try a little in a saucer; if the juice runs off as it cools, the jam
  requires longer boiling.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Some persons clarify all the sugar they use, but, for common preserves for private
  families, good loaf sugar, not clarified, answers the same purpose. After the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page304">{304}</span>preserve is poured into the jar, let it stand uncovered
  two days, then put brandy paper over, and cover with bladders, or paper, tied down close. Keep in
  a dry place, or they will be musty; but very hot, they will dry up, and be spoiled.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Clarify Sugar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Break lump sugar in pieces, and to every pound you put into the preserving-pan, add
   pint of water, and to every 2 lbs. sugar, the white of 1 egg, beaten; stir over the fire, till
  the sugar dissolves. When it boils it will throw up scum; take that off, with a slice, and lay it
  on a sieve, reversed, over a basin, that the syrup may run off. Pour into the pan the same
  quantity of cold water as you put in at first, and boil it up gently. Take off the scum, and
  return into the pan all the syrup which drains from it; keep it gently boiling until no scum
  rises.&mdash;<i>To Candy Sugar</i>, boil it till the surface is covered with little clusters, in
  the form of pearls.&mdash;<i>Moist Sugar</i> is clarified in the same way, but requires longer
  boiling and scumming; it answers for common jams, for immediate use, but they will not keep so
  long as when made of lump sugar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Currant Jelly.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Strip the currants and put them into an earthen pan or jar, set that in a vessel of
  boiling water, and keep it boiling till the fruit is all burst; then pass through a jelly bag, but
  do not squeeze it. When the juice has all run off, put it into a preserving-pan, and to each pint
  allow 1 lb. of lump sugar; less may do, but the jelly will not be so sure to keep. Boil the
  jelly, rather quickly, from fifteen to twenty minutes, scumming carefully all the time; try a
  little in a saucer, to see if it be stiff enough, then fill your pots or glasses; leave them
  uncovered two days; cover brandy papers over, and tie skins over tight. <i>White Currant
  Jelly</i>&mdash;The same; but rather less boiling. The sugar must be very fine, to insure delicate
  clearness for the jelly. <i>Black Currant Jelly</i>&mdash;The same as red currant jelly. When the
  juice is put into the preserving-pan, with the sugar, add a very little water. Less sugar
  <i>may</i> do. But boil it well.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page305">{305}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Currant Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">When jelly is made, if the bag be not squeezed, the fruit in it will have juice
  enough for jam; or, if not, put a fourth part of fresh fruit to it, then boil it up, with its
  weight of sugar, fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Raspberry Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take 4 parts of raspberries and 1 part of red currant juice, boil it fifteen or
  twenty minutes, with an equal weight of sugar. Skim off the dross, as it rises.&mdash;<i>Or</i>:
  use raspberries alone, and no juice.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: some persons recommend the <i>Antwerp</i>,
  they are so juicy as to require boiling by themselves until nearly dry; then add 1 lb. fine lump
  sugar to 1 quart fruit, then boil again fifteen minutes, and no more, or the colour will be
  injured.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Strawberry Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Gather fine scarlet strawberries, just ripe, bruise, and put them into a
  preserving-pan, with about a fifth part of red currant juice; strew over nearly their weight of
  sifted lump sugar, and boil quickly fifteen minutes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Gooseberry Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">This may be made of gooseberries only, in the same manner as directed for currant
  jam, or of a mixture of red or black currants and gooseberries.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Green Gooseberry Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">First crack them in a mortar, put them into a preserving-pan with  lb. lump sugar,
  to 1 lb. fruit, and boil till it begins to look clear. A nice preserve for tartlets.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Damson Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 1 lb. sugar to 1 lb. fruit, till the juice adheres to the fruit. For <i>open
  tarts</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Rhubarb Jam.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil an equal quantity of rhubarb, cut in pieces, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page306">{306}</span>gooseberries, before they are quite ripe, with  lb. loaf sugar to 1 lb.
  of fruit. Well boiled, it forms a rich jam, similar to apricot. <i>Or</i>: boil 6 lbs. fruit cut
  in square pieces, 6 lbs. lump sugar, and let it stand a few hours, to draw out the juice, boil the
  juice three different times, and pour over the rhubarb.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Black Butter.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">A very nice preserve to spread on bread, and is a mixture of currants,
  gooseberries, cherries, raspberries, or strawberries. To every 2 lbs. fruit, put 1 lb. sugar, and
  boil it till reduced one-fourth.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Fruit for Puddings.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare apples, pears, plums, and any fruit you have, and put them in a stone jar with
  brown sugar, to sweeten. Place the jar in a cool oven till the fruit is cooked.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To preserve Damsons, Bullaces, Morella Cherries, Gooseberries, and Currants, for
  Winter use.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">All these fruits may be put into wide-mouthed bottles, with about 6 oz. Lisbon
  sugar to each; put corks lightly in, and set them in a vessel of cold water, and then let it boil
  very gently till the syrup rises over the fruit; when the fruit is cold, make the corks tight, dip
  them in rosin, and tie bladders over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Bottle Green Gooseberries and Currants.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The same as the last receipt, only without sugar. Let them remain in the water till
  the fruit begins to shrivel; take them out, and when the fruit is cold, cork the bottles tight,
  and dip them in melted rosin. The rough sort is best.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Bottle Raspberries.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Mix an equal weight of crushed fruit and powdered loaf sugar, put them into
  wine-bottles, cork tight, and rosin the corks.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page307">{307}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Damsons for Tarts.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Gather damsons quite dry, put them into large stone jars, having pricked them with
  a pin, tie bladders over, and put the jars into a vessel of cold water; set that over the fire,
  and let it simmer (not boil) for two hours, or till you see the damsons begin to sink (the water
  should reach nearly to the top of the jars), then wipe the jars, and put them away in a dry
  place.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: choose jars to hold 8 or 9 lbs., of equal size at top and bottom; put in
  each jar one fourth of the fruit, then a fourth of good moist sugar (allow 3 lbs. sugar to 9 lbs.
  fruit), then another layer of fruit, and so on, till the jar is full; put it in an oven just hot
  enough to bake it through. When household bread is drawn the oven is generally hot enough for this
  purpose, and the jars may remain in all night. When the fruit is cold, put a clean stick, a little
  forked at one end, into the middle of the jar, leaving the forked end a little above the top; put
  a piece of white paper over the fruit (which ought to reach the neck of the jar), then run melted
  mutton suet over it, of an inch thick, and keep the jar in a cool place. When you open it, lift up
  the covering of suet by the stick.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apricots for Tarts.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the apricots in two, but do not pare them, take out the stones, and to every
  pound of fruit put 1 lb. lump sugar, pounded. Let them stand all night, then stew them gently over
  a slow fire till tender; skim them, as they simmer, till they are quite clear. Put them in pots,
  and when quite cold, cover with silver papers dipped in brandy, and tie down close.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apple Marmalade.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare and core the apples, leave them in a cool oven all night; the next day boil
  them up gently with an equal quantity of sugar, a little lemon peel and pounded cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apple Jelly.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take the blossoms and stalks out of 6 lbs. ripe apples, but do not pare them; put
  them into a stew-pan with <span class="pagenum" id="page308">{308}</span>scarcely enough water to
  cover them, cover close, and stew them to a pulp, pour it into a cloth, and hang that up to drain,
  but do not squeeze it. To a quart of juice allow 1 lb. lump sugar, boil gently to the consistency
  of other jelly, and before it is quite done add the juice of 2 lemons.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: pare and
  core your apples as if for pies, put them in the oven till quite soft, then squeeze them through
  thin muslin: to every pint add 1 lb. of lump sugar, half a wine-glassful of white wine, and a
  tea-spoonful of brandy, with the rind of a lemon; boil twenty minutes, or till it sets.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Peach, Apricot, or Plum Marmalade.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Skin the fruit, take out the stones, and mash it in a bowl; put an equal weight of
  fruit and sugar into a preserving-pan, boil it fifteen minutes, taking off all the scum. The
  kernels may be bruised and added.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Quince Marmalade.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut the fruit in quarters, and to 5 lbs. weight, and 3 lbs. sugar, add a pint of
  water; cover a piece of white paper over to keep in the steam, and simmer gently three hours; then
  beat them up to a jam, add  lb. more sugar, and simmer the jam another half
  hour.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: take the parings and cores of 2 lbs. quinces, cover them with water, and
  let it boil well; add 2 lbs. sugar, and when that is dissolved in the liquor, set it over a slow
  fire, and let it boil till it becomes a thick syrup; but the scum must be taken off as it rises.
  Let it get cold, then put in the quinces, with a little cochineal, and set it over a slow fire;
  stir and beat with a pewter spoon till it is done.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Quince Jelly.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Weigh them and measure 1 pint of water to 1 lb. fruit; pare the quinces as quickly
  as possible, as they are done, throw them into the water, then simmer gently until they are a
  little broken, but not long enough to redden the liquid, which should be very pale. Turn the whole
  into a jelly bag, and let it drain without pressure. Weigh the juice and boil it quickly 20
  minutes, take it from the fire and stir in till dissolved,  lb. lump sugar to each pound of
  juice, or <span class="pagenum" id="page309">{309}</span>rather more, if the fruit be very acid;
  then boil gently from ten to twenty minutes, or until it jellies strongly in falling from the
  skimmer, but stir it all the while, and take off all the scum as it rises. Pour it into glasses or
  moulds: it ought to be firm enough to turn out of the latter, and be rich and transparent.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Damson and Bullace Cheese.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put the fruit into a stone jar, cover it, and set it on a hot hearth, or in an
  oven, and let it coddle for about six hours, stirring it now and then. Pulp the damsons through a
  sieve, add  lb. lump sugar to every 2 lbs. of fruit, and some of the kernels, blanched, and
  beaten in a mortar. Put it all in a stew-pan, and boil very gently for two or three hours (it can
  hardly boil too long, as boiling makes it firm), skimming carefully all the time. Some persons
  boil it only one hour; it is clearer, but less firm. Some add a very few bitter almonds, blanched
  and cut small.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apricot Cheese.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare, then boil them with their weight of sugar, previously melted with a very
  little water; as the fruit breaks, take out the stones, blanch and pound the kernels, and put them
  to the fruit. Let the apricots boil, not more than half an hour. Pour the cheese into shapes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Orange Cheese.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scrape off the outward rind of Seville oranges, take out the pulp and skin, boil
  the peel tender, in water, beat it in a marble mortar to a pulp, add its weight of loaf sugar
  (already dissolved in the juice), and boil it quickly an hour; when done pour it into moulds, or
  on plates, to cut in shapes. Keep it in a dry place.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Pine Apple to Preserve.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare off the rind, and divide the pine apple into rather thick slices; boil the
  rind in  pint water, with 1 lb. loaf sugar in powder, and the juice of a lemon, twenty minutes.
  Strain this liquor, and boil the slices in it for half an hour; <span class="pagenum"
  id="page310">{310}</span>next day pour off the syrup, and boil it, taking care to scum as it
  rises, and pour it hot over the fruit; tie down the jar with a bladder, brandied paper being over
  the preserve.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cucumbers to Preserve.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose the greenest and most free from seeds, some small, to preserve whole, others
  large, to cut in long slices. Put them in strong salt and water, cover with vine leaves, and set
  them in a warm place till yellow; then wash, and set them over the fire, in fresh water, with a
  little salt and fresh vine leaves; cover the pan close, but take care the fruit does not boil. If
  they are not of a fine green, change the water, and that will help to green them; cover as before,
  and make them hot. When of a good colour, take them off the fire and let them get cold; then cut
  the large ones into quarters, take out the seeds and soft parts, put them into cold water, for two
  days, but change the water twice every day to take out the salt. Boil 1 lb. loaf sugar, and  pint
  of water, scum well, add the rind of a lemon, and 4 oz. scraped ginger. When the syrup is very
  thick, take it off the fire, and when cold, wipe the cucumbers dry, and put them in. The syrup
  should be boiled once in two or three days, for a fortnight, and you may add more to it if
  necessary. When you pour the syrup upon the cucumbers, be sure that it is cold. Cover close and
  keep in a dry place.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Strawberries to Preserve whole.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Choose fine scarlets, not over ripe; have their weight in sifted sugar, and
  sprinkle <i>half</i> over the fruit, and let it stand all night. Next day simmer it gently with
  the rest of the sugar, and 1 pint of currant juice, to 1 lb. of fruit, till it jellies.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Raspberries whole.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Gather them on a dry day, after a dry night. To 1 lb. fruit,  lb. sugar; put these
  in alternate layers in a preserving-pan, and keep shaking till it boils, then boil ten minutes,
  taking off all the scum. When cold, cover with brandy papers and bladders.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page311">{311}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Strawberries in Wine.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Fill a wide mouthed bottle three parts full of strawberries gathered quite dry,
  strewing amongst them 4 table-spoonsful of finely pounded sugar; fill up with fine old sherry, and
  cork it close.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Gooseberries whole.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">They must be just ripe, but no more. Clip off the top of each berry, make a little
  slit in the side, with a needle, that the sugar may penetrate, and take an equal weight of fruit
  and of sugar: boil them together, very gently, scum well, and when the skins begin to look
  transparent, take out the fruit, with a skimmer, and put it into jars or glasses; boil the syrup
  till it jellies, then strain, and pour it over the fruit.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Morella Cherries.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off the stalks, and prick the fruit with a needle, boil a fourth more than its
  weight of sugar, about five minutes, with  pint of red or white currant jelly; then put in the
  cherries, and simmer gently till they look bright. Some take out the stones.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cherries en Chemise.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut off half the stalk of large ripe cherries; roll them, one by one, in beaten
  white of egg, and then lightly in sifted sugar. Spread a sheet of thin white paper on a sieve
  reversed, and place that on a stove, spread the fruit on the paper, and send them from the stove
  to table. Bunches of currants, or strawberries, in the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cherries in Syrup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take out the stones, put the fruit into a preserving-pan, with 2 lbs. lump sugar to
  6 lbs. fruit, let it come slowly to a boil, set it by till next day, boil up again, repeat this
  the third day, when they will begin to look bright and plump; then pot them in the syrup.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page312">{312}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>To dry Apricots.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare thin, then cut in half, 4 lbs. of apricots, weighed after they are pared, and
  add 3 lbs. sifted sugar. When the sugar is nearly all melted, put it into a pan, and simmer it
  very gently over a slow fire; as each piece becomes tender lift it out into a china bowl, and when
  all are done, let the syrup cool a little, then pour it over the fruit. In two days pour out the
  syrup, leaving only a little in each half. Keep the apricots in a sunny place, and turn them every
  day, till quite dry. Keep in boxes, between layers of paper.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Dried Cherries.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To every 6 lbs. cherries, stoned, allow 1 lb. lump sugar. Scald the fruit in a
  preserving-pan, with very little water, then take it out, dry it: put it into the pan, with the
  sugar powdered, and put it over the fire to get scalding hot, then set it aside to get cold, put
  it on the fire again, and repeat this a third time, then drain them from the syrup, and lay them
  singly to dry on dishes, in the sun, or on a stove. Keep in boxes, between layers of white
  paper.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Orange Chips.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut oranges in halves, squeeze the juice through a sieve; cut the peel off very
  thin, and steep it a night in water, and the next day boil it till tender in the same water. Then
  cut the peel in strips and put them with the juice, in an earthen pan, with an equal weight of
  lump sugar, set it high over a moderate fire or stove, till the chips candy, stirring frequently;
  then spread them out in a cool room for a fortnight, to dry.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Orange Marmalade.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Get the clearest Seville oranges you can; cut them in 2, scoop out all the pulp and
  juice into a basin, and pick out the seeds and skins. Boil the rinds in spring water, changing
  that two or three times, to take off their bitterness: if for smooth marmalade, heat the rinds in
  a marble mortar, if for thick marmalade cut the rinds in thin pieces, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page313">{313}</span>add it to the juice and pulp, put it all into a preserving-pan, with
  double the weight of lump sugar, boil it over a fire, rather more than half an hour. Put it into
  pots, cover with brandy papers, and tie down close.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put 6 Seville oranges into a
  scale, and weigh their weight, and half their weight again, of lump sugar: to every lb. of fruit
  measure a wine-pint of cold spring water. Cut the fruit in quarters, remove the pips, and throw
  them into the water; then cut the oranges in slices on plates, so as not to lose any part of the
  juice or pulp, then take the pips out of the water, put all the fruit, juice, and sugar in, and
  boil it gently an hour, or until it is sufficiently consistent. Put by in pots. Both these are
  good receipts.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Oranges to Preserve.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut a hole at the stalk end, and scoop out the pulp, tie each one in muslin, and
  lay them in cold spring water, to cover them, for two days, changing the water twice a day; then
  boil them in the last water, till tender. Take the oranges out of the liquor and allow 2 lbs. of
  the best lump sugar, and 1 pint of water, to every lb. of fruit, and put it into the liquor; boil
  and scum till it is a clear syrup, let it cool, then put in the oranges, and boil them gently half
  an hour. Boil the syrup every day, for a week, or till it looks clear.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: grate the
  oranges, put them in water, change it twice a day, then boil gently, till tender, and put them in
  cold water again, for two or three hours. Cut a small piece off the top, take out the seeds, and
  to every orange allow  lb. of lump sugar, strew it over them in a preserving-pan, without any
  water, and set that over a gentle fire, turning the oranges occasionally: when clear, lift them
  out, put them into little pots, boil up the syrup, and pour it hot over the oranges. If the
  oranges do not look clear, boil them half an hour, for two or three days: then boil the syrup by
  itself, or make a fresh one thus: pare and core some green apples, and boil them to make the water
  taste strong; do not stir the apples, only put them down, with the back of a spoon; strain the
  water till quite clear, and to every pint put 1 lb. double refined sugar, and the juice of a lemon
  strained, boil it to a strong jelly, drain the oranges out of the syrup, each one in a <span
  class="pagenum" id="page314">{314}</span>jar the size of an orange, the hole upwards, and pour the
  jelly over. Cover with brandy papers, and bladders. Do <i>lemons</i> the same
  way.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: pare the oranges, tie them separately in cloths, boil them in water till
  tender, that a straw may pass through them: cut a hole in the stalk end, take out the seeds, but
  not the pulp. Make a syrup of sweet oranges, lemons, and sugar, and when clear, put in the
  oranges.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Apricots, Peaches, Magnum Bonum Plums, and Greengages.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare and stone the finest fruit, not over ripe, and weigh rather more than their
  weight of lump sugar. Spread the fruit in a dish, the split part upwards, strew the sugar over,
  and let them stand all night. Break the stones, blanch the kernels, and simmer the whole gently,
  till the fruit looks transparent: scum well, lift the fruit out carefully into pots, pour the
  syrup over, and, when quite cold, cover close.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Preserve Green Apricots.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Spread vine or apricot leaves at the bottom of the pan, then fruit, then leaves,
  till the pan be full, but the upper layer thick of leaves, fill up with water, and cover quite
  close, to keep the steam in. Keep the pan at such a distance from the fire, that in four or five
  hours, the fruit may be soft, not cracked. Make a thin syrup of sugar and some of the water, and
  drain the fruit; when both are cold, put the fruit and syrup back into the pan, no leaves, and
  keep it over the fire till the apricots are green, but they must not boil or crack; repeat this
  for two or three days: then pour off as much of the syrup as you think necessary, and boil it with
  more sugar and some sliced ginger to make a rich syrup; when this is cold, drain the apricots, and
  pour it over them. What there is left of the <i>thin</i> syrup will be useful to sweeten fruit
  tarts.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Orlean Plums.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">An equal quantity of sugar and of plums. The fruit gathered before it is quite
  ripe. Put it into a pan with <span class="pagenum" id="page315">{315}</span>cold water, simmer it
  till the skins appear to crack, so that you may peel them off. Have ready, a thin clear syrup made
  of 1 lb. sugar, and a gill of water, put in the plums, give them a gentle boil, and put them by in
  a basin, till the next day; if they then appear done enough, drain them from the syrup, if not,
  boil again, and remain till the following day; then drain them, add the remainder of the sugar to
  the syrup, boil it till rich, and quite clear; put the plums into jars, pour the syrup over, leave
  them open till the next day, then put brandy papers over, and over them run mutton suet.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Jargonelle Pears.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare smoothly and thinly, some large, well shaped pears. Simmer in a thin syrup,
  and let them lie two days. Then pour off the syrup, add more sugar: simmer and scum it; then put
  the pears in, simmer till they look transparent, lift them out into pots, pour the syrup over, and
  tie closely. Rather more than the weight of fruit in sugar. A grain of pounded cochineal may be
  put in the syrup; lemon juice is an improvement.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Quinces.</i></p>

  <p>Pare the quinces very thin, and put them into a stew-pan; cover with their parings, and fill
  the saucepan with hard water, set it over a slow fire, and keep the lid close that the steam may
  not escape; when the fruit is tender take it out, and put to it 1 quart of water, 2 lbs. lump
  sugar, to make a clear syrup: put in the quinces, boil them ten or twelve minutes, and set them
  by, for four or five hours; then boil again five or six minutes, take them off the fire, and set
  them by two days: boil again, ten minutes, with the juice of 2 lemons. Let the quinces be quite
  cold, put them into broad pans, singly, and pour the syrup over. Cover with brandy papers, and
  skins over the whole.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: cut them in quarters, and to 5 lbs. fruit, put 3 lbs.
  sugar, and  pint water; lay a piece of white paper over, to keep in the steam, and let them
  simmer gently, three hours.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Fruit <i>pastes</i> are made by boiling the fruit with clarified sugar to a thick
  marmalade; moulded into thin cakes, and dried in a stove.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page316">{316}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Candy Fruit.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put fruit, finished in syrup, in a layer, in a new sieve, and dip it quickly into
  hot water; spread it on a napkin before the fire to drain, and do more in the sieve; sift double
  refined sugar over the fruit, till white all over. Spread it on the shallow ends of sieves to dry
  in a <i>warm</i> oven, turning it two or three times. Do not let it get cold before it is dry.
  Watch it carefully.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Almacks.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">1 lb. each of baking pears, apples, apricots, and plums; slice the two first, and
  open the others, put them, in alternate layers, in an earthen jar, in a slow oven. When the fruit
  is soft, squeeze it through a cullender, put to it 1 lb. lump sugar, and simmer gently, stirring
  all the while, till it leaves the pan clear, then put it in small moulds, or drop it in little
  cakes; when cold, put them by.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Peaches, Apricots, and Plums in Brandy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Gather peaches before they are quite ripe, prick them with a needle, and rub off
  the down with a piece of flannel. Pass a quill carefully round the stone to loosen it. Put them
  into a large preserving-pan, with cold water, rather more than enough to cover them, and let it
  gradually become scalding hot. If the water does more than simmer very gently, or the fire be
  fierce, the fruit may crack. When tender, lift them carefully out, and fold them in flannel, or a
  soft table cloth, in several folds. Have ready a quart, or more, as the peaches require, of the
  best brandy, and dissolve in it 10 oz. of powdered sugar. When cool, put them into a glass jar,
  and pour the brandy and sugar over. Cover with leather, or a bladder.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cherries in Brandy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Gather morella cherries on a dry day, when quite ripe; cut off <i>half</i> the
  stalk, and put them into wide mouthed bottles, strewing layers of finely pounded sugar between.
  Allow to each bottle half the weight of the fruit in sugar. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page317">{317}</span>When the fruit reaches the neck of the bottle, fill up with brandy; cork
  and rosin it tight.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Grapes in Brandy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put some close bunches, of any sort, into a jar (having pricked each grape), strew
  a good quantity of pounded sugar candy over them, and fill up the jar with brandy. Tie a bladder
  over, and keep in a cool place.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Barberries for Tartlets.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pick barberries without stones, from their stalks, and put them into a stone jar,
  in a kettle of water, or on a hot hearth, and simmer very slowly till the fruit is soft: then put
  it into a pan with  lb. lump sugar to 1 lb. barberries, and boil slowly for fifteen minutes. Use
  no metal but silver.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Barberries in Bunches.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">Tie the stalks of the fruit on little flat pieces of wood, 3 inches long, a  inch

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">PICKLES.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">The</span> great art of pickling consists in using good vinegar, and in
  selecting the various articles, at the proper seasons.&mdash;Pickles are indigestible, but their
  liquor is good to give relish to cold meat, therefore the strongest vinegar should be used,
  because a less quantity will suffice. They should be kept in a dry place, and glass jars are best,
  because then it is easy to perceive whether the vinegar diminishes, and if it does, more should be
  boiled with spice, and poured over the pickles. Fill the jars 3 parts full with the pickles, but
  always let there be 3 inches above their surface of vinegar. If earthenware jars are used, let
  them be unglazed; and vinegar should always be boiled in unglazed earthenware; indeed, it ought
  never to <i>boil</i> at all, but be just scalding hot, for boiling causes much of the strength to
  evaporate. Keep the bottles closely stopped, with bungs, and a bladder, wetted in the pickle. When
  you have opened a bottle, cork it again, put a fresh bladder over, if you wish the pickles to
  keep. When the pickles are all used, the vinegar should be boiled up with a little more spice, and
  bottled when cold. The colour of pickles is a matter of no small difficulty, though of the
  greatest consequence, when used by way of ornament. A fine colour is sometimes preserved by
  keeping pickles a long time in scalding hot vinegar, the vessel being covered. When a bottle of
  capers or pickles is opened, it should be kept filled, by fresh boiled vinegar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Walnuts.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Make a strong brine of salt and water, about  lb. salt to a quart of water, and
  steep the walnuts in it a week, previously pricking them with a large needle; then put them, with
  the brine, into a stew-pan, gently simmer them, pour off the liquor, lay the walnuts on a sieve to
  drain in the air two days, to turn them black. Have ready made a pickle of strong vinegar; add to
  each quart 1 oz. ginger, 1 oz. strong pepper, 1 oz. eschalots, 1 oz. salt,  oz. allspice, and  a
  drachm of cayenne (some persons add garlic, brown mustard-seed, bay leaves, cloves, mace, chopped
  chilies, and horse-radish); put all into a stone jar, tie over a bladder wetted with vinegar, and
  over that a leather; keep it close by the side of the fire two days and nights; shake it
  frequently. Put the walnuts into jars, and pour the pickle hot over them; when cold, put in bungs,
  and tie wetted bladder over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Walnuts, Green.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The best time is while the shells are still tender, and before they are quite ripe.
  Lay them in a strong brine of salt and water for ten days, changing the brine twice during that
  time; put in a thin board to float over, that the air may not get to them and turn them black;
  then pour the brine from the walnuts, and run a large needle several times through each one; lay
  some vine leaves at the bottom of an earthen pan, put in the walnuts, and cover with more leaves,
  fill up the vessel with water, and put it on the fire till scalding hot; then pour off the water,
  put fresh in, let that become hot, pour it off, and repeat this once again; scrape off the husks,
  rub the walnuts smooth with flannel, and throw them into a vessel of hot water. Boil, three
  minutes, a quart of vinegar for every 50 walnuts, with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page320">{320}</span>white pepper, salt, ginger, cloves, and cayenne (in the proportion of the
  last receipt), and after rubbing the walnuts, dry them out of the water, and pour the vinegar over
  them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Gherkins.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The best are about 4 inches long, and 1 inch in diameter. Put them into unglazed
  jars, or open pans, and pour salt and water over ( lb. salt to a quart of water), cover, and set
  them by the side, when not convenient for them to stand before the fire; in two or three days they
  will be yellow; pour off the water, and cover them with scalding hot vinegar: set them again
  before the fire, and keep them of an equal heat, if possible, for ten days, and they will become
  green; then pour off the vinegar, and have ready to pour over the gherkins (in jars), the same
  pickle as that for walnuts, leaving out the eschalots if you choose. The vinegar poured from the
  gherkins should be bottled, for it will be good cucumber vinegar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Onions.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take off the tops and coats of small round silver button onions, the size of a
  nutmeg, and put them into a stew-pan three parts full of boiling water; put no more at once than
  just enough to cover the top of the water. As soon as the onions look transparent, take them up in
  a sieve, lay them on a folded cloth, whilst you scald the remainder. Make them quite dry with
  these cloths, then fill the jars three parts full, and pour over them the following pickle, quite
  hot: to a quart of strong vinegar put 1 oz. allspice, 1 oz. ginger, 1 oz. mace, 1 oz. scraped
  horse-radish, 1 oz. black pepper, and 1 oz. salt; infuse it by the fire three or four days; when
  the pickle and the onions are cold, bung the jars, and cover them, first with bladder wetted in
  vinegar, then with leather.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put the onions into salt and water, change that every
  day for three days, then put them in a stew-pan with cold milk and water, let that stand over a
  fire till <i>near</i> to a boil, take out the onions, dry, and put them into jars, and pour a
  pickle over of good vinegar, salt, mace, and pepper, boiled and become cold.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page321">{321}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cucumbers and Onions.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil in 3 pints of vinegar  lb. flour of mustard, mixed as for table use; let it
  get cold; slice 12 large cucumbers, and  gallon large onions; put them into jars with 2 oz.
  ginger,  oz. white pepper, and a small quantity of mace and cloves, and pour the vinegar, cold,
  over them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Cabbage.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut out the stalk, and divide a firm, dark coloured middling sized cabbage, then
  cut in slices the breadth of straws; sprinkle salt over, and let it lie two days; then drain the
  slices very dry; fill the jar, 3 parts full, and pour a hot pickle over them, of strong vinegar,
  heated with black pepper, ginger, and allspice. Cover the jar to keep the steam in, and when the
  pickle is cold, put in bungs, and tie bladders over.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Melon Mangoes.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Cut a small square piece out of one side, and take out the seeds; fill them with
  brown mustard seeds, garlic, eschalot, scraped horse-radish, ripe capsicums, and a little finely
  pounded ginger: stuff the melons as full as the space will allow, replace the square piece, and
  bind them up tightly with thread. Boil a gallon of white wine vinegar, with  oz. mace,  oz.
  cloves,  oz. ginger,  oz. black and long pepper, and  oz. cayenne; as it is coming to a boil,
  pour in a wine-glassful of essence of horse-radish, and of garlic vinegar.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Beet Root.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil them very gently from an hour and a half to two hours, or till 3 parts done;
  take them out of the water to cool; peel and cut them in slices about half an inch thick. Prepare
  a pickle of good vinegar, and to each quart 1 oz. black pepper,  oz. salt,  oz. horse-radish, 
  oz. ginger, and a little cayenne; infuse these by the fire three days, and let the pickle be cold
  before you pour it over the beet-root.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page322">{322}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mushrooms.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take the red inside out of the large ones, and rub both large and small, with a
  piece of flannel and salt; put them into a stew-pan, with a little mace and pepper, and strew salt
  over; keep them over a slow fire, till the liquor which will be drawn, dries up again; shake the
  stew-pan often; then pour over as much vinegar as will cover them, let it become hot, but not
  boil, and put all into a jar.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: boil buttons in milk and water till rather tender,
  put them into a cullender, and pump cold water on them till they are cold; put them into salt and
  water, for twenty-four hours, then dry them in a cloth. Make a pickle of distilled vinegar, mace,
  and ginger, if to be <i>white</i>, if not, white wine vinegar. It must be cold before you pour it
  over the pickle.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>India Pickle.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put into a jar a gallon of white wine vinegar, 1 lb. sliced ginger,  oz. turmeric
  bruised,  lb. flour of mustard,  lb. salt, 1 oz. long pepper, bruised; peel  lb. garlic, lay it
  on a sieve, sprinkle it with salt, let it stand in the sun, or before the fire, three days to dry,
  then put it into the vinegar. Place the jar by the side of the fire, cover close, and let it
  remain three days, shake it every day, and it will be ready to receive the
  vegetables.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: boil in a gallon of vinegar, ten minutes, 2 oz. black and white
  peppercorns, 2 oz. flour of mustard, 2 oz. turmeric, and 2 oz. ginger, 1 oz. of the best cayenne,
  and a good quantity of young horse-radish: (you may add  oz. more turmeric, and 2 oz. white
  mustard seed), add curry powder and eschalots.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: to a gallon of the strongest
  vinegar allow 3 oz. curry powder, the same of flour of mustard, rub these together with  pint of
  olive oil, 3 oz. ginger bruised, 1 oz. turmeric, and  lb. of eschalots, and 2 oz. garlic (both
  these sliced and slightly baked in the Dutch oven),  lb. salt, and 2 drachms cayenne; put it all
  into a jar, cover with bladder wetted in the vinegar, and keep it by the side of the fire three
  days, shake it several times during each day, and it will be ready to receive the vegetables.
  Great care is required, to prepare the vegetables; they should be gathered, as they come in
  season, on a dry day. <span class="pagenum" id="page323">{323}</span>Parboil in salt and water
  strong enough to bear an egg, then drain and spread them in the sun, before the fire, or on a
  stove, to dry; this will occupy two days; then put them into the pickle. The vegetables are, large
  cucumbers sliced, gherkins, large onions sliced, small onions, cauliflowers, and brocoli in
  branches, celery, French beans, nasturtiums, capsicums, white turnip radishes, coddling apples,
  siberian crabs, green peaches, a large carrot in slices, nicked round the edges, and a white
  cabbage cut up; neither red cabbage nor walnuts. Small green melons are good; cut a slit to take
  out the seeds, parboil the melons in salt and water, drain and dry, then fill them with mustard
  seed, and 2 or 3 cloves, tie round, and put them into the pickle.&mdash;Some persons boil it up
  after the vegetables are in. These receipts are all good.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lemons.</i></p>

  <p>Cut them across, about half way through, and put 1 tea-spoonful of salt into each one, let
  them lie in a deep dish five or six days; to each lemon add 1 nutmeg, grated, 1 table-spoonful of
  black mustard seed, and a little mace; boil till tender, in vinegar to cover them, then put them
  by. Keep the jar filled with vinegar.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: cut the lemons in 4 parts, but not through,
  fill with fine salt, put them in layers in a jar, and sprinkle fine salt over each layer. Examine
  and turn them, every five or six days, and in six weeks they will be ready. If dry, add lemon
  juice to them.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: grate the rind of 8 lemons, rub well with salt, and turn them
  every day for a week: put them into a jar with 2 oz. race ginger, a large stick of horse-radish
  sliced, 2 tea-spoonsful flour of mustard, 3 of cayenne, 1 oz. turmeric, and vinegar enough to
  cover them. Put more vinegar if required.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><i>Cauliflower</i> and <i>brocoli</i> before they are quite ripe, may be picked in
  neat branches, and pickled, the same way as <i>gherkins</i>; also <i>French beans</i>, nasturtiums
  and radish pods, in the same way.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Camp Vinegar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put into a pint of the best vinegar, 1 drachm of cayenne, 3 table-spoonsful soy, 4
  table-spoonsful walnut catsup, a small clove of garlic, minced fine, and 4 anchovies chopped.
  Steep a month, shake it every other day, strain it, pour it into pint or  pint bottles.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Cucumber Vinegar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pare 8 or 10 large cucumbers, cut in thin slices, and put them into a china bowl,
  with 2 onions sliced, a few eschalots, a little salt, white pepper, and cayenne. Boil a quart of
  <span class="pagenum" id="page327">{327}</span>vinegar, let it cool, then pour it into the bowl;
  cover close, let it stand three days, and bottle it.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Basil Wine.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">About the end of August fill a wide mouthed bottle with fresh leaves of basil,
  cover with sherry and infuse them ten days; strain and put in fresh leaves, infuse another ten
  days, then pour off, and bottle it. A table-spoonful to a tureen of mock turtle, just before it is
  served.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Raspberry Vinegar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">This, besides being a nice sauce for batter and other light puddings, is good with
  water, as a summer drink, also for colds, sore throat or fever. It will not be good unless made
  with fresh fruit; and the finer the sugar, the clearer the syrup.&mdash;To 1 quart of fruit add 1
  pint of vinegar (cold); cover close for twenty-four hours; pour off the liquor, and put to it a
  quart of fresh fruit, cover close and let it again stand for twenty-four hours; repeat this for
  the third time. Then boil up the vinegar, with a lb. of lump sugar to each pint, until it becomes
  a syrup.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">Some</span> of the following are useful in culinary, others in
  medicinal compounds, and some in both.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Essence of Ginger.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put 3 oz. fresh grated ginger, and 1 oz. thinly cut lemon peel into a quart of
  brandy, let it stand ten days, and shake it every day.&mdash;<i>Essence of Allspice</i>&mdash;Oil
  of pimento, 1 drachm, strong spirits of wine, 2 oz., mix them by degrees; a few drops will flavour
  a pint of gravy or wine.&mdash;<i>Essence of Nutmeg, Clove, or Mace</i>&mdash;Put 1 drachm of
  either into 2 oz. of the strongest spirit of wine. A few drops will be
  sufficient.&mdash;<i>Essence of Cinnamon</i>&mdash;2 oz. spirits of wine, and 1 drachm of oil of
  cinnamon.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Essence of Savoury Spice.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">1 oz. black pepper,  oz. allspice finely pounded,  oz. grated nutmeg, infused in
  a pint of brandy ten days.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Essence of Cayenne.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Steep 1 oz. good cayenne in 1 pint of brandy, or spirits of wine, a fortnight, then
  strain and bottle it, for use.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Essence of Seville Orange and Lemon Peel.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">Rub lump sugar on the lemon or orange, till quite saturated with the rind, then
  scrape the sugar so saturated into the jar you keep it in, rub the rind again, and so on, till you
  have enough, press the sugar down close, and keep it for use. This imparts a very nice flavour to
  custards and puddings. Tincture of lemon peel is made by paring the peel, and steeping it in
  brandy.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">CATSUPS.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">These</span> should be made at home, as well as pickles. A small
  quantity of catsup every year is sufficient, and very little time and trouble will provide it. It
  should be put into small bottles (filled to the neck), for when a cork is once drawn, catsups,
  essences, and pickles begin to decay. The bottles kept lying on their side, because this tends to
  preserve the cork. Keep them in a dry place.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Mushroom Catsup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Made in September. The large flaps are best. Break off whatever parts are dirty or
  decayed, and lay the rest in pieces, in an earthen pan in layers, with salt between; put a folded
  cloth over, and let it stand a day and night, or longer, by the side of the fire; then strain off
  the liquor into the saucepan, and to every quart, put  oz. black peppercorns, a  oz. allspice, 
  oz. sliced ginger, a few cloves, and 2 or 3 blades of mace. Boil the liquor, fifteen minutes, over
  a quick fire, though it will be stronger and keep longer, if boiled until the quantity be reduced
  one half, and then the spices need not be put in until it has been boiling about twenty minutes.
  When you take it off the fire, let it stand to settle, pour off clear, and bottle it; the sediment
  may be strained and bottled also, for it answers for fish sauce and brown soup. Anchovies, bay
  leaves, and cayenne, may be added to the spices. Dip the corks in melted rosin. Some put a
  table-spoonful of brandy into each pint bottle. A table-spoonful of mushroom catsup is sufficient
  to flavour  pint of sauce.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: break them in a pan, sprinkle salt between and let
  them stand till the next day, when, if their liquor be not drawn, add fresh mushrooms and more
  salt: the next day pour off <span class="pagenum" id="page330">{330}</span>the liquor, boil it
  three hours, let it settle, strain and add to every 2 quarts,  oz. of cloves,  oz, nutmegs, 
  oz. mace, 1 oz. race ginger, 1 oz. jamaica, and 1 oz. black pepper, some eschalots and
  horse-radish, and 1 pint of Port wine, then boil it again half an hour. This will keep well.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Walnut Catsup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Gather them green, prick them with a large needle, and let them lie three days, in
  an earthen pan, sprinkled with a handful of salt, and a very little water. Mash them well each
  day, with a rolling pin. On the fourth day, pour some scalding hot salt and water over, mash
  again, and let them stand the whole day; then with a spoon or cup, lift out what liquor there is,
  pound the walnuts well, and pour a little good vinegar and water over them, which will extract all
  their juice; pour this off, and put to it what you already have, boil it slowly, and scum well.
  When there is no longer any scum, put to every quart 1 oz. bruised ginger, 1 oz. allspice, 1 oz.
  black pepper, a  oz. each of cloves, mace, and nutmeg; simmer it three quarters of an hour, when
  cold, bottle it.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: when of a full size, but tender, pound the walnuts, strain out
  the juice, let it settle and boil it up, taking off the scum as it rises: to each 2 quarts allow 3
  lbs. anchovies, and boil gently till they are dissolved, then strain, and boil again with a small
  quantity of garlic and eschalots, a stick of cinnamon,  an oz. each of black pepper, cloves and
  mace, the rind of 2 lemons, 3 pints of vinegar, 4 wine-glassfuls of port wine, and the same of
  strong beer; boil it gently three quarters of an hour; scum well. The longer this is kept the
  better.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Oyster Catsup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Use fresh Melton oysters. Pound them in a marble mortar, and to a pint of oysters
  add a pint of sherry. Boil them up, then add 1 oz. salt, 2 drachms of pounded mace, and 1 drachm
  of cayenne; boil up again, skim, then strain it through a sieve, and when cold, bottle it, and
  seal down the corks. Brandy will assist to keep it: it is a nice catsup for white
  sauces.&mdash;Cockles and muscles, the same way, but a pounded anchovy or two may be added to give
  <span class="pagenum" id="page331">{331}</span>flavour.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: boil 100 oysters in 3
  pints of sherry, with 1 lb. of anchovies, and 1 lemon sliced, for half an hour; then strain it,
  add a  oz. cloves,  oz. mace, 2 oz. eschalots, and 1 nutmeg sliced, boil it a quarter of an
  hour: when cold, bottle it, with the spice and eschalots. If the oysters are large they should be
  cut.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tomata Catsup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take 6 doz. tomatas, 2 doz. eschalots, 1 doz. cloves of garlic, 2 sticks of
  horse-radish, and 6 bay leaves; slice and put them in 1 pint of vinegar, with a handful of salt,
  2 oz. pepper, 2 oz. allspice, and a little mace. Boil well together, ten minutes, pour it into a
  pan, let it stand till the next day, add a pint of sherry, give it one boil, take it off the fire,
  skim it, and after it has stood a few minutes, add a tea-cupful of anchovy sauce, and a
  tea-spoonful of cayenne. Strain, and when cold, bottle it. The pulp may be rubbed through a sieve
  for sauce.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Lobster Catsup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">Get a lobster of about 3 lbs. weight, and full of spawn, pick out all the meat, and
  pound the coral with 6 anchovies in a marble mortar: when completely bruised, add the meat, pound
  and moisten it with  a pint of sherry or Madeira, a tea-spoonful of cayenne, a wine-glassful of
  chili or eschalot vinegar, and 1 pint of eschalot wine; mix well, put it into wide-mouthed
  bottles, on the top put a dessert-spoonful of whole black peppers, to each bottle: cork tightly,
  rosin them, and tie leather over. Keep in a cool place. 4 or 5 table-spoonsful to a tureen of

  <h1 class="ac" title="XXVIII. The Cellar" style="margin-bottom:3.2ex;"><span class="larger"><span
  class="gsp">CHAPTER XXVIII.</span></span></h1>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE CELLAR.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">A good</span> cellar, besides its general convenience, in regard to a variety
  of household purposes, is indispensable to every one who wishes to have good beer. However skilful
  and successful the brewer, no beer, nor, indeed, any fermented liquors (with few exceptions), can
  be kept good, any length of time, especially in the summer months, unless they be secured from
  being turned sour by heat, and by sudden variations of the atmosphere. No cellar can be considered
  perfect which is not below the surface of the ground. Houses in the country are frequently without
  the convenience of underground cellaring; but every house ought, where it is practicable, to be
  built over cellars, which, independently of other advantages, contribute very materially to the
  dryness and warmth of the building.</p>

  <p>The directions for brewing, given by my father, in his "<i>Cottage Economy</i>," are so
  circumstantial, and so simple, clear, and intelligible, that any person, however inexperienced,
  who reads them with attention, may, without further instruction, venture to brew without risk of a
  failure. It is certain that many families, who had previously never thought of brewing their own
  beer, have been encouraged by the plainness and simplicity of his directions to attempt it, and
  have never since been without good home-made beer. Brewing is not, perhaps, in strictness, a
  feminine occupation; there are, nevertheless, many women who are exceedingly skilful in the art.
  It is obviously not within the province of the mistress of a house, even to superintend the
  brewing department, but, when circumstances may render it necessary that she should undertake the
  task, she cannot, when about to give her directions, do better than consult the "<i>Cottage
  Economy</i>."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page333">{333}</span></div>

  <p>The utensils necessary are: a copper, a mash-tub and stand, an under-back, to stand under the
  edge of the mash-tub, when the malt is put in, two buckets, a strainer, a cooler, a tun-tub, and a
  cask to put the beer in.</p>

  <p>Having these utensils, the next thing is, materials for making the beer. These are, soft water,
  malt, and hops. The water should be <i>soft</i>, because hard water does not so well extract the
  goodness of the malt; but if you have none but hard water, soften it by letting it stand two days
  in some open vessel in the air. The malt should be (or, at least, usually is) ground or bruised
  into a very coarse meal. The hops should be fresh, of a bright yellow, and highly scented. Farnham
  hops are the cleanest and best. I give receipts for finings, but do not recommend them, though
  they certainly will make beer clear which might not be so without them.</p>

  <p>The process is this: if you mean to make about a hogshead of beer, take 120 gallons of water
  (soft, or softened by exposure to the air), and put it into the copper. When it has boiled, pour
  it into the malt. This is rather a nice matter; if you put in the malt too soon, it cakes and
  becomes dough. The old-fashioned rule is, to let the steam keep flying off till you can see your
  features in the water; but as the weather frequently renders this an uncertain criterion, take
  your thermometer, and plunge it into the water now and then, and when the quicksilver stands at
  170, the heat is about right. Pour the malt in gently, taking care to stir it about as it goes in,
  so as to separate it, and make every particle come in contact with the water; when it is all in,
  stir it for twenty minutes or half an hour; then put your stirring-stick across the mash-tub, and
  cover cloths all over to keep in the heat. Let this, which is called <i>mashing</i>, go on for
  four or five hours. It cannot well be too long about. When the malt has remained soaking all this
  time, draw off the liquor by means of your buckets, and put it into the copper again. This liquor
  is called the "<i>sweet wort</i>." Light the fire under the copper, and pour into it, for <i>every
  bushel</i> of malt that you have mashed,  lb. of <i>hops</i>, or, if not very good, 1 lb. for
  every bushel. Stir these well into the wort, and keep it on a good hard boil for an hour, being
  very particular to make it boil all the while. This being done, you have now to cool the beer:
  <span class="pagenum" id="page334">{334}</span>rake the fire out from under the copper, and again
  take out your liquor in your buckets; put the cooler in some place away from the chances of dirt
  falling into it, and where it may stand level; then strain the liquor into it. The next operation
  is, the <i>working</i>; and the most difficult part of this is, to ascertain when, precisely, the
  liquor is cool enough to bear it. Experienced brewers generally ascertain this by the feel of the
  liquor, by merely putting the finger into it; but it is better to use the thermometer again;
  plunge it in, and when the quicksilver stands at 70 the heat is right. Then, with your buckets
  again, put the whole of the liquor out of the cooler into the tun-tub; and take a pint, or
  thereabouts, of fresh yeast (balm), and mix it in a bowl with some of the liquor; then pour it
  into the tun-tub with the liquor that is now cool enough to be set to work; mix it up a little by
  dipping the bowl in once or twice, and pouring it down from a height of two or three feet above
  the surface of the liquor in the tun-tub; then cover the tun-tub with cloths, as you did the
  mash-tub. In a few hours it will begin to work; that is, a little froth, like that of bottled
  porter, will begin to rise upon the surface; when this has risen to its height, and begins to
  flatten at the top and sink, it should be skimmed off, and is good yeast, and the beer is ready to
  put into the cask in your cellar. When you put it into the cask, let it stand a day, without being
  bunged down, because it may work a little there. When you find that it does not, then, if you use
  finings, put them in, and bung down tightly.</p>

  <p>The following receipt is given to me by a gentleman who is celebrated for the excellence of his
  beer.</p>

  <p>Suppose the brewer is about to make a hogshead of beer of good strength. Eight bushels of malt
  will be sufficient. Let the water, if not <i>soft</i>, stand two days in some vessel in the open
  air, which will soften it. One hundred and twenty gallons will be sufficient; and, if he uses
  ground malt, let him remember to attend to the heat of the water in the mash-tub before he puts it
  in, and also to the stirring and separating as it goes in. When it has stood long enough in the
  mash-tub, he must draw it off, and put it into the copper, and then throw in  lb. of good hops
  <i>for every bushel of malt</i>; or, if the hops be not really good and strong, 1 lb. <i>to the
  bushel</i>. Boil the liquor at least an hour; <span class="pagenum" id="page335">{335}</span>but
  be very particular to make it boil the whole time; for much depends on this. Beer that has not
  boiled well is always crude, and soon spoils. It is the great fault of most brewers, that, to save
  the evaporation caused by a good boiling, they cool the liquor before it is sufficiently cooked.
  When it has boiled the proper time, pour it immediately, hot as it is, into a clean cask; put the
  bung and vent-peg in lightly; watch the cask, and when you find fermentation going on, which will
  show itself by a little oozing out of froth round the bung, take out both bung and vent-peg, and
  let them remain out till the working is over, and the froth begins to sink down into the cask;
  then put the bung and vent-peg in tightly, and the brewing is over. The cask should not be filled
  to running over, yet very little space should be left below the bung when driven in, as the body
  of air that would fill this vacancy would deaden the beer.</p>

  <p>This mode deviates from that practised by my father, in two essential points: namely, the
  <i>cooling</i> and the <i>working</i> of the beer; for, in the last receipt it is not cooled at
  all, and no yeast is required to work it. If it answers, it is a less troublesome, and,
  calculating the cost of the coolers, less expensive mode of brewing than that detailed in the
  "<i>Cottage Economy</i>."</p>

  <p class="sp3">The "Cottage Economy" speaks of the necessity of keeping the casks in good order;
  and this is a matter, though of great importance, often neglected. New casks should be seasoned
  before they are used; one way recommended is, to boil 2 pecks of bran or malt dust in a copper of
  water, pour it hot into the cask, stop close, and let it stand two days, then wash it out well,
  and drain the cask. Servants are negligent about vent-pegs and bungs. They should be put in tight,
  the tap taken out, and a cork put in, as soon as the last beer is drawn. If the casks were kept in
  proper order, beer would not so often be spoiled. Of equal consequence, is the cleanness of the
  brewing utensils. They should be scoured well with a brush and scalding water, after they have
  been used. Do not use soap or any thing greasy. A strong ley of wood ashes may be used, if there
  be any apprehension of taint. When hops are dear, gentian may be substituted in part for them, in
  the proportion of 8 oz. gentian, and 2 lbs. hops, to 12 bushels of malt.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page336">{336}</span></div>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Fine Beer.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Draw out a gallon of ale, put to it 2 oz. isinglass, cut small and beaten; stir the
  beer, and whip it with a whisk, to dissolve the isinglass, then strain, and pour it back into the
  cask, stir well, a few minutes, and put the bung in lightly, because a fresh fermentation will
  take place. When that is over stop it close; let the vent-peg be loose. Fermentation is over, make
  the vent-peg tight; and in a fortnight the beer will be fine. Drink 3 parts, and bottle the
  rest.&mdash;A good way to fine new beer, is to run the wort through a flannel into the tun, before
  it has worked.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>For Stale Small Beer.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put 1 lb. chalk, in small pieces, into a half hogshead, and stop it close. It will
  be fit to drink on the third day.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put half chalk, and the other half hops.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Bottle Beer.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Stone bottles are best. The best corks the cheapest, put them in cold water half an
  hour before you use them. The bottles perfectly clean and sweet, fill them with beer, put in each
  bottle a small tea-spoonful of powdered sugar, and let them stand uncorked, till the next day:
  then cork, and lay the bottles on their sides; or, better still, stand them with the necks
  downwards.&mdash;When a bottle is emptied, the cork should be returned into it directly, or it
  will become musty.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Make Cider.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The apples quite ripe, but not rotten. If the weather be frosty, gather the apples,
  and spread them from 1 to 2 feet thick, on the ground, and cover with straw; if mild, let them
  hang on the trees, or remain under, if fallen, until you are ready to make the cider. It should
  not be made in warm weather, unless they are beginning to rot, in which case you must not delay.
  Unripe fruit should be made by itself, as the cider never keeps.&mdash;Large cider mills will make
  from 100 to 150 gallons in a day, according to the difference in the quality of fruit, some sorts
  of apples being <span class="pagenum" id="page337">{337}</span>more tough and less juicy than
  others, consequently requiring more grinding. Not more than 7 or 8 bushels should be put into the
  mill at once. They should be ground, till the kernels and rinds are all well mashed, to give the
  flavour to cider. Pour the cider from the mill into a press; press the juice well, then pour it
  into hogsheads. When it has done fermenting, and the time for this is very uncertain, rack it off
  into other hogsheads, let it settle, and then bung it down.</p>

<hr style="width:10em"/>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">ENGLISH WINES AND CORDIALS.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">Fruit of every kind should be gathered in dry sunny weather, quite ripe. All home
  made wines are the better for a little brandy; though some persons never use any.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Clear Wine.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Dissolve  lb. hartshorn shavings in cider or rhenish wine; this is sufficient for
  a hogshead.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: to 2 table-spoonsful boiled rice, add  oz. burnt alum in powder: mix
  with a pint, or more, of the wine, stir it into the cask, with a stout stick, but do not agitate
  the lees.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: dissolve  oz. isinglass, in a pint or more of the wine, mix with it 
  oz. of chalk in powder, and put it into the cask: stir the wine, but not the lees.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>British Sherry, or Malt Wine.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Take 12 quarts of the best sweet wort, from pale malt, let it cool and put it into
  a 10 gallon cask. Take as much water as will be required to fill up the cask, put it on the fire,
  with 22 lbs. of the best lump sugar, stir from time to time, and let it boil gently about a
  quarter of an hour, taking off the scum as it rises. Take it off the fire, let it cool, pour it
  into the cask, and put in a little good yeast. It may, perhaps, continue to ferment two or three
  weeks; when this has ceased, put in 3 lbs. raisins, chopped fine; these may cause fresh
  fermentation, which must be allowed to subside; then put in the rinds of 4 Seville oranges, and
  their juice, also a quart of good brandy; at the end of three <span class="pagenum"
  id="page338">{338}</span>or four days, if a fresh fermentation have not taken place, put the bung
  in tight. Keep it a year in the cask, then bottle it; the longer it is kept the
  better.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: stir 42 lbs. good moist sugar into 14 gallons of water, till it is
  dissolved, then boil it twenty minutes; let it cool in a tub, then put in 16 lbs. good Malaga
  raisins, picked and chopped; when it is quite cold pour in 2 gallons of strong beer ready to be
  tunned, and let it stand eight days; then taking out the raisins, put it into a 16 gallon cask,
  with 2 quarts of the best brandy, 1 lb. bitter almonds blanched, and 2 oz. isinglass. Bottle it in
  a year.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>British Madeira.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 30 lbs. moist sugar in 10 gallons of water, half an hour, and scum well. Let
  it cool, and to every gallon put 1 quart of ale, out of the vat; let this work, in a tub, a day or
  two; then put it in the cask, with 1 lb. sugar candy, 6 lbs. raisins, 1 quart of brandy, and 2 oz.
  isinglass. When it has ceased to ferment, bung it tight, for a year.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>English Frontiniac.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Boil 11 lbs. lump sugar in 4 gallons of water, half an hour; when only milk warm,
  put it to nearly a peck of elder flowers, picked clear from the stalks, the juice and peel of 4
  large lemons, cut very thin, 3 lbs. stoned raisins, and 2 or 3 spoonsful yeast: stir often, for
  four or five days. When quite done working, bung it tight, and bottle it in a week.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Red Currant Wine.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To 28 lbs. of moist sugar, allow 4 gallons of water, pour it over the sugar, and
  stir it well. Have a sieve of currants (which usually produces between 10 and 11 quarts of juice),
  squeeze the fruit with the hand, to break the currants, and as you do so, put the crushed fruit
  into a horse-hair sieve, press it, and when no more will run through the sieve, wring the fruit in
  a coarse cloth. Pour the juice on the sugar and water, mix it, and then pour it all into a 9
  gallon cask, and fill it with water, if the barrel should not be full.&mdash;The cask should be
  filled up <span class="pagenum" id="page339">{339}</span>with water every day, while the wine
  ferments, and be bunged up tight, when it ceases. This is a cheap and simple method of making
  currant wine.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put a bushel of red, and a peck of white currants, into a tub or
  pan, squeeze well; strain them through a sieve upon 28 lbs. of powdered sugar; when the sugar is
  dissolved put in some water in the proportion of 1 gallon to 1 gallon of juice, pour it all into
  the barrel, add 3 or 4 pints of raspberries, and a little brandy.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Raisin Wine.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put the raisins in at the bung-hole of a close cask (which will be the better for
  having recently had wine in it), then pour in spring water, in the proportion of a gallon to 8
  lbs. raisins; the cask should stand in a good cellar, not affected by external air. When the
  fermentation begins to subside, pour in a bottle of brandy, and put the bung in loosely; when the
  fermentation has wholly subsided, add a second bottle of brandy, and stop the cask close. In a
  year it will be fit to bottle, immediately from the cask, without refining. Malaga raisins make
  the finest wine: Smyrna, rich and full, and more resembling foreign wine.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Gooseberry Wine.</i></p>

  the sugar is dissolved, tun the wine, and let it work, which it will do in a week, or little more,
  keeping back some of the wine to fill up the cask, before you stop it close. Let it stand in the
  barrel six months, bottle it, in six more begin to drink it.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">THE DAIRY.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">This</span>, of all the departments of country house-keeping, is the one which
  most quickly suffers from neglect; and of all the appendages to a country dwelling, there is
  nothing which so successfully rivals the flower garden, in exciting admiration, as a nice dairy.
  From the show-dairy, with its painted glass windows, marble fountains and china bowls, to that of
  the common farm house, with its red brick floor, deal shelves, and brown milk-pans, the dairy is
  always an object of interest, and is associated with every idea of real comfort, as well as of
  imaginary enjoyment, attendant upon a country life.</p>

  <p>The management of this important department in a country establishment, from the milking of the
  cows, to the making of the butter and the cheese, must necessarily be almost wholly intrusted to a
  dairy maid, who ought to be <i>experienced</i> in the various duties of her office, or she cannot
  be skilful in the performance of them. Those persons who have excelled in dairy work, have
  generally learnt their business when quite young, as a knowledge of it is not to be hastily
  acquired. The great art of butter and cheese-making, consists in extreme care and scrupulous
  cleanliness; and an experienced dairy maid knows, that when her butter has a bad taste, some of
  the dairy utensils, the churn, the pail, or the pans, have been neglected in the scalding,
  <i>or</i>, the butter <span class="pagenum" id="page349">{349}</span>itself not well made: unless,
  indeed, as is sometimes the case, the fault lies in the food provided for the cows.</p>

  <div class="bq1 sp2">
    <p class="sp0"><i>Note.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Cobbett's</span> "Cottage Economy" contains
    directions for the keeping and feeding of cows.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The utmost care and diligence, on the part of the dairy maid, may, however, prove ineffectual,
  if the dairy itself be not convenient, and provided with the proper utensils. The principal
  requisites of a dairy are, coolness in summer, and a temperature warmer than the external air, in
  very cold weather. The building should, therefore, be so constructed, as to exclude the sun in
  summer, and the cold in winter. The windows should never front the South, South East, or South
  West. They should be latticed, or, which is preferable, wired, to admit a free circulation of air,
  with glazed frames, to be shut and opened, at pleasure. The room should be lofty, and the walls
  thick, as nothing more effectually preserves an even temperature, or excludes extremes of cold and
  heat. It should be paved with brick or stone, and laid with a proper descent, so that all water
  may be drained off. The floor should be washed every day in summer, and three or four times a week
  in the winter.</p>

  <p>The utensils should not be scalded in the dairy, as the steam from hot water is injurious to
  milk. Neither rennet, cheese, or cheese-press, should be kept in it, as they diffuse an acidity.
  The dairy should not be used as a larder; it cannot be too scrupulously devoted to its own proper
  purposes.</p>

  <p>The cows should be milked twice a day, and as nearly at the same hour as possible; and they
  should be milked <i>quite clean</i>: this is a matter of great consequence, not only as being
  conducive to the health of the animals, but if neglected, very much diminishes the value of their
  produce; for that which is milked last, is much richer than that which is first milked.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Some persons when they strain the milk into pans, for creaming, pour into each one,
  a little boiling hot water (in the proportion of 1 quart of water to 3 pails of milk); this was
  never done in our dairy in Hampshire, but I believe the effect is, to destroy the taste of turnip.
  It is very good, for this purpose, to keep a piece of saltpetre in the cream pot. This latter
  should have a stick in it, and be well <span class="pagenum" id="page350">{350}</span>stirred up
  twice a day, or, every time the dairy maid goes into the dairy. The cream should not be kept
  longer than four days, before it is made into butter. If twice a week be too often to churn, it
  ought not to be less frequent than three times in a fortnight. In private families the milk is
  generally skimmed only once, and this leaves the milk very good; but where butter is made for
  sale, and quantity rather than quality, is the object, a second skimming is generally resorted to.
  Some dairy maids object to the second skimming, on account of the bitter taste, which they say the
  cream so skimmed is sure to give the butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Make Butter.</i></p>

  <p>In summer the churn should be filled with cold spring water, and in winter scalded with hot
  water, preparatory to churning; then pour the cream in, through a straining cloth. In warm weather
  the churning should be performed in a cool place; and, in a general way, the butter will come in
  an hour; but it often does come in half the time, though it is not the better for coming so
  quickly. In very cold weather the churning must be done in a warm place; indeed, it is sometimes
  necessary to bring the churn near the fire, but this should never be allowed but in extreme cold
  weather, when the butter will sometimes be five or six hours in coming: when this is the case, it
  is almost always of a white colour and a poor taste. The butter being come, pour off the
  buttermilk, leaving the butter in the churn, pour in a pailful of cold water, wash the butter
  about, pour off the water, and pour in a fresh pailful; let the butter stand in this ten minutes.
  Scald a milk-pan, and stand it half an hour or more in cold water, lift the butter out of the
  churn into it, pour fresh water over, and wash the butter about well, drain the water off as dry
  as possible, and then proceed to work the buttermilk out of the butter. Some persons do this with
  the hands (which should first be dipped in hot water), others with a straining-cloth: if the
  latter, scald and wring it dry; then work the butter by squeezing it, by degrees, from one side of
  the pan to the other, pour cold water over to rinse, and pour that off; then work the butter back
  again, and rinse again; repeat this till the rinsing water is no longer coloured with milk, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page351">{351}</span>and then you may be sure that the buttermilk is all
  worked out; for, if there be any of it left, the butter will have streaks of white when cut, and
  will not be sweet. Having worked out the milk, the next thing is, to put in the salt. The quantity
  must depend, in some measure, on taste; some persons like their butter very much salted, while
  others think that the flavour of salt should not be distinguishable in fresh butter. Roll it quite
  fine, and you may allow  lb. to 5 lbs. butter: press the butter out thin, sprinkle over it some
  salt, fold up the butter, press it out again, strew over more salt, fold it up again, and so on,
  till all the salt is in, work the butter about well, to mix the salt with it, and pour off
  whatever liquid there may be in the pan. Take the butter out, a piece at a time (if the quantity
  be great), on a square wooden trencher (previously scalded and dipped into cold water), and,
  either with the hand, a fresh cloth, or a flat, thin piece of wood (made for the purpose), beat
  the butter out thin, fold it up, beat it out again, and repeat this several times, till the water
  is all beaten out. By the time it has arrived at this latter stage, it ought to be quite firm,
  except in extreme hot weather, when no pains are sufficient to make it so. When the water is all
  out, make up the butter, in what form and size you choose; place it on a board, or a marble slab,
  in a cool place, but not before a window, as too much air will not benefit it; spread over it a
  cheese-cloth, first scalded, then dipped in cold water, and it will harden in a few hours.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Different parts of England vary so much in the butter they produce, that what is
  considered very good in one county would be regarded as inferior in another. This is caused by
  difference in the pasturage, and not by variation in the mode of preparing the cream or making the
  butter; except, indeed, in some parts of the West of England. In Devonshire the cream is always, I
  believe, prepared according to the following directions, which were written for me by a Devonshire
  lady.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To make Butter without a Churn.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Spread a linen cloth in a large bason, pour in the cream, tie it up like a pudding,
  fold another cloth over it, and bury it in a hole two feet deep, in light earth, put all the earth
  <span class="pagenum" id="page352">{352}</span>lightly in, lay a turf on the top, and leave it
  twenty-four hours; take it up, and it will be found in the state that butter is when it is just
  come. The buttermilk is lost, but this method answers very well in hot weather. We tried it in
  America.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Clouted Cream.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Strain the milk, from the cow, into glazed earthenware vessels, and let it stand
  twelve hours in summer, and twenty-four, or thirty-six, in winter, before you scald it. Then place
  the vessels over a very small fire or hearth, for half or three-quarters of an hour, until the
  surface begins to swell, and the shape of the bottom of the pan appears on it (but if made hot
  enough to simmer, it will be spoiled); then set it to cool, and in twelve hours' time in summer,
  and eighteen or twenty-four in winter, the cream may be taken off with a skimmer which has
  holes.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Butter from Clouted Cream.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Scald well a large wooden bowl, then rinse it with cold water, but do not wipe it
  dry. Put in the cream, work it well with the hand (in one direction only), until the milk comes
  from it, which should be drained off, and will serve for making cakes and puddings; when the milk
  is all beaten out, wash the butter with cold water to cleanse it from the milk, then salt it,
  thus: spread it out on the bottom of the bowl, sprinkle salt over, roll it up, wash it again with
  cold water, beat out again, then shape and print it, as you please. The hands should be well
  washed in hot water, before you begin to work the butter. In winter and in weather of a moderate
  temperature the butter is speedily made, but in very hot weather it will take nearly or quite an
  hour of stirring round, and working with the hand, before it will come into butter.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Pot Butter for Winter use.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">In the summer, when there is plenty of butter, care should be taken to preserve
  enough for winter use. But observe, that none but good butter, well made, and quite free from
  buttermilk, will pot well. Have potting pans, to hold from 6 to 10 lbs. of butter. Put a thick
  layer of butter <span class="pagenum" id="page353">{353}</span>in the pan, press it down hard,
  then a layer of salt, press that down, then more butter, and so on: allowing 1 oz. of salt to
  every lb. of butter. If too salt, it can be freshened by being washed in cold water, before it is
  sent to table. Always keep the top well covered with salt, and as that turns to brine, more salt
  may be required. Tie paper over, and keep the pan in the dairy, or cellar. Some persons use one
  quarter part of lump sugar, and the same of saltpetre, to two parts of common salt.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To Make Cheese.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">The milk should be just lukewarm, whether skimmed or not. To a pailful put 2
  table-spoonsful of rennet, cover the milk, and let it stand, to turn: strike down the curd with
  the skimming dish, or break it with the hand, pour off the whey, put the curd into a cheese-cloth,
  and let two persons hold the four corners, and move it about, from side to side, to extract the
  whey: lay it into the vat, fold the cloth smoothly over the cheese, cover it with the lid of the
  vat, and put a weight of 10 or 12 lbs. on the top. Let it stand twelve hours; then take it
  carefully out, put it on a wooden trencher, or a clean hanging shelf, and sprinkle salt thickly
  over the top. The next day, wipe it dry all over, turn it the other side upwards, sprinkle salt on
  the top, and repeat this every day, for a week: after that, turn it every day, and occasionally
  wipe it.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: to 6 quarts new milk, add 2 quarts lukewarm water, and sufficient
  rennet to turn it: when the curd is settled put it into a small vat, about a foot square, and 1
  inch deep, with holes in the bottom; place a lid on it, and put on that a lb. weight, for a
  day.&mdash;<i>Another</i>: put 5 quarts of the last of the milking into a pan, with 2
  table-spoonsful of rennet; when the curd is come, strike it down with the skimming dish two or
  three times, to break it: let it stand two hours. Spread a cheese-cloth on a sieve, put the curd
  on it, and let the whey drain; break the curd with the hand, put it into a vat, and a 2 lbs.
  weight on the top. When it has stood twelve hours, take it out and bind a cloth round it. Turn it
  every day, from one board to another. Cover the cheese with nettle leaves, and put it between 2
  pewter plates, to ripen. It will be ready in three weeks.</p>

  SICK.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Often</span> when the Doctor's skill has saved the life of his patient, and it
  remains for the diligent nurse to prepare the cooling drinks and restorative foods, the taste and
  the appetite of sick persons are so capricious that they will reject the very thing which they had
  just before chosen: and frequently, if consulted upon the subject, will object to something which,
  if it had appeared unexpectedly before them, they would, perhaps, have cheerfully partaken of.
  Everything which is prepared for a sick person should be delicately clean, served quickly, in the
  nicest order; and in a small quantity at a time.</p>

  <p class="sp3"><i>See, in the Index</i>, <i>Mutton</i> and <i>Chicken</i> broths.</p>

  blotting paper over the top.&mdash;<i>Tapioca</i> is very nice in broths for
  invalids.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: put <span class="pagenum" id="page355">{355}</span>a knuckle of veal,

  and 2 oz. currants stoned, in 3 pints of water, till reduced half; add a little grated lemon
  peel.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Saline Draughts.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Pour  pint spring water on 2 drachms salt of wormwood, and 4 table-spoonsful lemon
  juice; 2 table-spoonsful lump sugar may be added, if approved.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: pour 4
  table-spoonsful lemon juice on 80 grains of salt of wormwood, add a small piece of sugar, finely
  pounded. When the salt is killed, add 4 table-spoonsful of plain mint water, and the same of
  spring water; strain, and divide it into 4 draughts, 1 to be taken every six hours. If the patient
  be bilious, add 10 grains of rhubarb, and 4 of jalap, to the morning and evening
  draught.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: pour into one glass a table-spoonful of lemon juice, and dissolve in it
  a lump of sugar; dissolve  a tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda in 2 table-spoonsful of water, in
  another glass: pour the two together, and drink in a state of effervescence. For delicate persons,
  a wine-glassful of sherry takes away the debilitating effect.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Coffee.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">To be good must be made of a good kind, for poor, cheap coffee, though ever so
  strong, is not good. A breakfast-cup, quite full, before it is ground, makes a quart of good
  coffee. When the water boils in the coffee-pot, pour in the coffee, set it over the fire; the
  coffee will rise to the top, in boiling, and will then fall; boil it slowly three minutes longer,
  pour out a cupful, pour it back, then another, and let it stand five minutes by the side of the
  fire. A small <span class="pagenum" id="page364">{364}</span>piece of dried sole skin will fine
  it, or 2 lumps of sugar.&mdash;Coffee requires cream or boiled milk.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Chocolate.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Some prefer milk alone, others milk, and half its quantity in water; let it boil
  (be careful it do not burn), and put in the chocolate, scraped; in quantity according to the
  strength desired; mill it quickly, and let it boil up, then mill it again.&mdash;For sick persons,
  use thin gruel, not milk.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Tea.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">For invalids who do not take tea for breakfast, its flavour may be given, by
  boiling a dessert-spoonful of green tea in a pint of milk, five minutes, then strain it. This
  renders it comparatively harmless.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Barley Sugar.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Put the beaten whites of 2 eggs in an earthen pipkin with a pint of water, and 2
  lbs. clarified lump sugar, flavoured with essence or oil of lemons; boil quickly, skimming all the
  time, till stiff enough. Pour into a shallow brown dish, and form it as you please.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Everton Toffy.</i></p>

  <p class="sp5">To  lb. treacle, put  lb. sugar, and 2 oz. butter, boil them together until they
  become hard when dropped in cold water. Then take the pan off the fire, and pour the toffy
  immediately into a tin dish.</p>

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">MEDICAL RECIPES.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">In</span> almost every family little illnesses are likely to occur, which may
  require medicine, though not, perhaps, the aid of a Doctor; it is, therefore, convenient to keep a
  small supply of common medicines in the house, especially in the country. The list I give was
  written by a medical gentleman; but while I am induced to insert it in this work, from a belief
  that it may, in some cases, be found of use, I cannot refrain from observing that it is far from
  my desire to lead any young housekeeper to adopt the fatal error that <i>Doctors</i> may be
  dispensed with, when anything approaching to serious illness betrays itself. Too many instances
  have occurred wherein life has been lost, for the want of timely medical skill, which might,
  perhaps, have arrested the progress of disease at its feeble commencement, and before it had
  acquired sufficient strength to baffle opposition.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The following receipts have all been tried by the persons who gave them to me; many
  of them may be old fashioned, but some I can assert to be good. That for the <i>croup</i> has been
  resorted to, several times in our own family, and always with success. The complaint is a violent
  one, its attacks are sudden and the progress of the disease is so rapid that there ought not to be
  an <i>instant</i> of delay in administering the remedies. The <i>croup</i> is of common occurrence
  in America, and the following receipt came from that country.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>For the Croup.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">The healthiest children are the most liable to this complaint, which is caused by
  sudden changings in the atmosphere, draughts of cold air, and checking of the perspiration, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page366">{366}</span>It betrays itself by a hoarse croaking cough, something
  like the hooping cough.&mdash;Put the child into a warm bath placed opposite the fire; cover it
  all over with flannel, or a blanket; in the meantime chop an onion or two, squeeze the juice
  through a piece of muslin, mix it in the proportion of 1 tea-spoonful with 2 table-spoonsful
  treacle; get the child to swallow as much of this, from time to time, as you can: when it has been
  in the bath ten or twelve minutes, take it out in a blanket, and as quickly as you can, rub the
  stomach and chest with a mixture of rum and oil, or goose grease, wrap the child in a flannel and
  put it to bed, or keep it in the lap by the fire; if the child go to sleep, it will be almost sure
  to awake free from the disorder. These remedies may not succeed if there be delay in applying
  them.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>For Weakness of Stomach.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">1 drachm of prepared Columba root, and  drachm of rhubarb root, infused in  pint

  cloves, and 2 hops, cover close and let it stand all night: a tea-cupful first in the morning, and
  again an hour before dinner. If giddiness ensues, the camomile does not agree with the patient,
  and must not be continued. Where it does agree, this will be found to restore the appetite.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>Camphor Julep.</i></p>

  <p class="sp3">Rub  oz. of camphor in a mortar, with a few drops of spirits of wine, and a few

  <p class="sp4 ac" style="margin-bottom:2.5ex;"><span class="x-smaller">COOKERY FOR THE
  POOR.</span></p>

  <p><span class="sc">I have</span> selected such receipts as appear to be the most profitable to
  adopt; and the insertion of these will accomplish nearly all that I can hope to effect under the
  above head, for we all know that a supply of food alone can avert the misery of hunger, and that
  if there were a thousand different <i>systems</i> for feeding the poor by the means of voluntary
  aid, the success of each system must depend on the practical efforts made in its application.</p>

  <p>Some persons object to making soups, &amp;c., for the poor, on the ground that poor people are
  not so well satisfied with this mode of relief as they would be if the materials were given them
  to dispose of in their own way. This objection is just in some cases, but not so in all; because,
  as respects domestic management, there are two distinct classes among the poor, the one having
  learned arts of economy while faring well, and the other being ignorant of those arts from never
  having had enough means to encourage them to make such things their study.</p>

  <p>It is true that the old-fashioned English cottagers, that class so fast falling into decay, are
  by no means wanting in the knowledge of housekeeping and of cooking in an economical manner. Not
  only does their labour in the fields produce fertility, bring the richest harvests, and cause
  those appearances on the face of the country which make it admired as one of the most beautiful in
  the world; but the habitations of the labourers themselves, their neat cottages, and their gardens
  so abounding at once with the useful and the elegant; these have always been regarded as one
  complete feature, and that not the least important, in the landscape of England. And, if we look
  at the interior of these dwellings, we there find every thing corresponding with what we have
  remarked without. Where the father, after having done a hard day's work for his master, will
  continue, in the evening, to toil upon his own small <span class="pagenum"
  id="page383">{383}</span>plot of ground for a couple of hours, and where the children are bred up
  to respect the edges of the borders, the twigs of the shrubs, and the stems of the flowers, and to
  be industrious and even delighted in such things, it is natural that the mother should take the
  same pains with all that belongs to the inside of the dwelling. And, accordingly, those who have
  occasionally visited the poor of the rural districts of England, must have observed, that if they
  are often deficient in the means of living well, they are, as often, patterns of cleanliness, and
  as anxious to make a respectable appearance with their scanty furniture, to polish their half
  dozen pewter platters, to scrub their plain table or dresser, to keep clean and to set in order
  their few cups and saucers of china-ware, as their betters are to make a display of the greatest
  luxuries of life. These excellent habits of the people are so fixed, that we see a portion of them
  still clinging to those labourers, perhaps the most of all to be commiserated, who are employed in
  the factories of the north of England.</p>

  <p>But the condition of the other class is very different. Some of these have never, from their
  earliest infancy, been accustomed to any of those scenes in which, though there be difficulties,
  there are circumstances to excite perseverance, and to reward painstaking. These are born in
  absolute want; their experience under the roof of their parents has been but a course of
  destitution; and they go forth into the world rather as fugitives from misery than as seekers to
  be more prosperous. If they obtain employment, their labour is perhaps repaid by wages barely
  sufficient to keep them alive; destitute of the means of practising anything like household
  management, never having known what it is to have a home, worthy to be so called, for a single
  day, it is scarcely possible for them to obtain that knowledge, simple as it is, which is required
  to contrive the various modes of making much out of a little. Besides, if the poor people existing
  in this condition were ever so inclined to do well, there are the strongest inducements held out
  to them to mismanage their small stock of means; they are continually standing in need of some
  temporary sustenance; and, who can wonder if thus bereft of all power to <i>provide</i> or to
  <i>economise</i>, they yield to destruction, and suffer themselves to be allured by the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page384">{384}</span>glare of the gin-palace, or the revelry of the pot-house!
  It is one of the signs of misery with such persons, that they are little acquainted with the art
  of cookery. Here and there may be found a poor woman who has become skilful by serving in the
  kitchens of other persons: but this is only an exception, and too rare to be of account.</p>

  <p>In almost every family there are, occasionally, things which may be spared from its
  consumption, to be converted, by an experienced cook, into palatable and nourishing food for poor
  people, but which, if given to them in the shape of fragments, they would be totally ignorant how
  to make use of. Such, for instance, as bones with very little meat on them, trimmings of meat, of
  poultry, &amp;c., some cooked, some uncooked, crusts of bread, and pieces of dripping; yet these,
  with a little pepper, salt, and flour to thicken, may, by careful cooking and scumming, be made to
  produce an excellent meal for a family of children.&mdash;Few servants are unwilling to take the
  trouble of helping their poor fellow creatures, and, if the head of every family would give as
  much as she can spare to the poor who live immediately in her own neighbourhood, more general good
  would be done than ladies can reasonably hope to do by subscribing their money to "societies,"
  which, though they may have been established by the best-intentioned persons, and for the kindest
  of purposes, can never be so beneficial in their effects as that charity which one individual
  bestows on another. The relief which is doled out by a "Society" is accompanied by very imperfect,
  if any, inquiries into the particular circumstances of the persons relieved; by no expressions of
  sympathy, by no encouraging promises for the future, to cheer the heart of the anxious mother as
  she bends her way homeward with her kettle of soup: the soup which has been obtained by presenting
  a ticket is apportioned to the little hungry creatures, without their being reminded who it is
  that has so kindly provided for them, and after it is eaten there is no more thought about the
  source whence it came than about the hunger which it has removed. The private mode of charity is
  superior to the public in every way. There are great advantages arising from the former which the
  latter can never procure. Not only must the attentions of a known individual be the most <span
  class="pagenum" id="page385">{385}</span>gratefully appreciated by a poor man and woman, but the
  child which has often gone to bed satisfied and happy, after a supper provided by some good
  neighbour, cannot be expected to grow up without some of those feelings of personal respect and
  attachment for its benefactor, which, while they prevent the contrast of riches with poverty from
  becoming odious, are the strongest assurances of union between him who claims a property in the
  soil and him whose labour makes that property of value. Self-interest and humanity are not the
  least at variance in this matter; the same course of policy is dictated to both. It may seem
  glorious to be advertised throughout Europe, and to be read of in newspapers, as a large
  subscriber to a public Institution; but the benefits which are confined to a single parish are the
  more lasting from being local, and the fame of the distributor, though bounded in distance, is all
  the more deserved, the longer kept alive and cherished, and, consequently, the better worth
  endeavouring to obtain.</p>

  <p>The soup I would recommend for poor people, should be made of the shin, or any coarse parts of
  beef, shanks and scrags of mutton, also trimmings of any fresh meat or poultry. 1 pound of meat to
  every pint of soup (that is, every three  pints of water), and then all the meat should not be
  boiled to rags, but some be left to eat. There should be a sufficient quantity of turnips,
  carrots, onions and herbs; also pepper and salt; and dumplings, of either white or brown flour,
  would be a good addition. A quart of soup, made in this way, with about  lb. of meat, and a
  dumpling for each person, would be a good dinner for a poor man, his wife and children; and such a
  one as a lady who has a kitchen at her command, may often regale them with. Less meat will do
  where there is pot-liquor. The liquor of all boiled meat should be saved, in a clean pan, and made
  the next day into soup. That of a leg of mutton will require but little meat in addition, to make
  good soup. The liquor of any fresh meat, of boiled pork, if the latter be not very salt, will make
  good peas soup, without any meat.&mdash;Soak a quart of peas all night, in soft water, or
  pot-liquor, and, if the former, some bones or pieces of meat; a small piece of pork would be very
  good. Put in 2 onions, cut up, a head of celery, a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page386">{386}</span>bunch of sweet herbs, and what salt and pepper you think it requires. Let
  it boil, and then simmer gently <i>by the side</i> full three hours, or longer if the peas be not
  done; stir the peas up from the bottom now and then. When you have neither meat nor pot-liquor,
  mix 2 or 3 oz. of dripping with an equal quantity of oatmeal, and stir it, by degrees, into the
  soup, or boil in it some dumplings of flour and suet.</p>

  <p>In houses where a brick oven is heated once a week or oftener, for bread, it would give little
  additional trouble to bake a dish of some sort or other for a poor family. Soup may be made in
  this way: first put the meat on the fire in just enough water to cover it; when it boils, take off
  the scum, pour off the water, put the meat into an earthen pan, with 3 carrots cut up, a turnip, 2
  onions, pepper and salt, and stale dry crusts of bread; pour over boiling water, in the proportion
  of a gallon to 2 lbs. meat, and let it bake three hours. Shanks of mutton, cowheels, ox and
  sheep's head, may be cooked in this way, but the two latter must be parboiled, to cleanse them;
  and will require four or five hours' baking. The soup made of ox head is not so nourishing as that
  of shin of beef. If there be room in the oven, a plain pudding may be baked as follows. Pour
  boiling skim milk over stale pieces of bread, and cover with a plate or dish. When it has soaked
  up the milk, beat the bread, dust in a little flour, add sugar, an egg or two, or shred suet, or
  pieces of dripping, and more milk if required; butter a brown pan, pour in the pudding, and bake
  it three-quarters of an hour.&mdash;<i>Or</i>: a batter pudding, made with two eggs, a quart of
  milk; or if eggs be scarce, leave them out, and use dripping; rub it into the flour, with a little
  salt, mix this by degrees with some milk into a batter and bake it. A batter pudding of this kind,
  rather thick, is very good with pieces of meat baked in it; in the proportion of 1 lb. solid meat,
  to a batter made with 1 quart of milk. Pickled pork, not very salt, makes a very good pudding. A
  plain rice pudding, without egg or butter, made with skim milk, and suet or dripping, is excellent
  food for children. But rice costs something, and my object is to point out to young housekeepers
  how they can best assist the poor without injury to their own purses; and, therefore, I do not
  <span class="pagenum" id="page387">{387}</span>urge the use of barley, rice, sugar, currants,
  &amp;c. &amp;c. They do not, of themselves, produce much nourishment; sufficient, perhaps, for
  children, and for persons who do not labour, but for hard working people, the object is to provide
  as much animal food as possible; therefore, when money is laid out, it ought to be for meat.</p>

  <p>Puddings with suet approach very nearly to meat. A thick crust, with a slice of bacon or pork
  in it, and boiled, makes a good pudding.</p>

  <p><i>Hasty pudding</i>, made with skim milk, in the proportion of 1 quart to 3 table-spoonsful of
  flour, would be a good supper for children, and the cost not worth consideration, to any lady who
  has a dairy.</p>

  <p><i>Buttermilk</i> puddings, too, are cheap and easily made.</p>

  <p><i>Milk</i> is of great value to the poor.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Where there is a garden well stocked with vegetables, a meal for poor people may
  often be prepared, at little expense, by cooking cabbages, lettuces, turnips or carrots, &amp;c.
  &amp;c. in the water which has been saved from boiling meat, or thin broth. The vegetables, stewed
  slowly till tender, with or without a small piece of meat, and the gravy seasoned and thickened,
  will be much more nourishing, as well as palatable, than plain boiled.</p>

  <p class="ac"><i>To dress Cabbages, Lettuces, Brocoli and Cauliflower.</i></p>

  <p>Put  lb. bacon or pork, in slices, at the bottom of a stew-pan, upon them a large cabbage, or
  two small ones, in quarters; a small bunch of herbs, some pepper and salt, the same quantity of
  bacon or pork on the top, and a quart of water or pot liquor; let it simmer till the cabbage is
  quite tender.</p>

  <p class="sp4"><i>Another</i>: wash a large cabbage or lettuce, open the leaves, and put between
  them little pieces of bacon or pork, and any fragments of fresh meat cut up; tie up the cabbage
  securely, and stew it till tender in a very little broth or water, with a little butter rolled in
  flour, and some seasonings. A little meat will go a great way in making this a palatable dish.
  Turnips, carrots, and potatoes, either raw, or such as have been cooked the day before, may be
  <span class="pagenum" id="page388">{388}</span>just warmed up, or stewed till tender in a little
  weak broth, thickened with flour, and seasoned with salt and pepper, and then, poured with the
  gravy on slices of bread in a tureen, they will be good food for children.</p>

  <p class="sp5">When I am asked what books a young man or young woman ought to read, I always
  answer, Let him or her read <i>all</i> the books that I have written. This does, it will doubtless
  be said, <i>smell of the shop</i>. No matter. It is what I recommend; and experience has taught me
  that it is my duty to give the recommendation. I am speaking here of books other than THE
  REGISTER; and even these, that I call my LIBRARY, consist of <i>thirty-nine</i> distinct books;
  two of them being TRANSLATIONS; <i>seven</i> of them being written <span class="smaller">BY MY

  of subjects, and all of them very <i>dry</i>; nevertheless, the manner of treating them is in
  general such as to induce the reader to go through the book when he has once begun it. I will now
  speak of each book separately, under the several heads above-mentioned. N.B.&mdash;All the books

  SPELLING-BOOK.</span></p>

  <p class="sp3">I have been frequently asked by mothers of families, by some fathers, and by some
  schoolmasters even, to write a book that they could <i>begin</i> teaching by; one that should
  begin at a beginning of book learning, and smooth the way along to my own English Grammar, which
  is the entrance-gate. I often promised to comply with these requests, and, from time to time, in
  the intervals of political heats, I have thought of the thing, till, at last, I found time enough
  to sit down and put it upon paper. The objection to the common spelling books is, that the writers
  aim at teaching several important sciences in a little book in which the whole aim should be the
  teaching of spelling and reading. We are presented with a little <span
  class="sc">Arithmetic</span>, a little <span class="sc">Astronomy</span>, a little <span
  class="sc">Geography</span>, and a good deal of <span class="sc">Religion</span>! No wonder the
  poor little things imbibe a hatred of books in the first that they look into! Disapproving
  heartily of these books, I have carefully abstained from everything beyond the object in view,
  namely, the teaching of a child to spell and read; and this work I have made as pleasant as I
  could, by introducing such stories as children most delight in, accompanied by those little
  woodcut illustrations which amuse them. At the end of the book there is a "Stepping-stone to the
  English Grammar." It is but a step; it is designed to teach a child the different <i>parts of
  speech</i>, and the use of <i>points</i>, with one or two small matters of the kind. The book is
  in the duodecimo form, contains 176 pages of print, and the price is 1s. 6d.&mdash;W. C.</p>

  it</i> before it went to press, and that made him a <i>grammarian at once</i>; and how able an one
  it made him will be seen by his own Grammar of the <span class="sc">Italian Language</span>, his
  <span class="sc">Ride in France</span>, and his <span class="sc">Tour in Italy</span>. There are
  at the end of this Grammar "Six Lessons intended to prevent Statesmen from using false Grammar;"
  and I really wish that our statesmen would attend to the instructions of the whole book. Thousands
  upon thousands of young men have been made correct writers by it; and it is next to impossible
  that they should have read it with attention without its producing such effect. It is a book of
  principles, clearly laid down; and when once these are got into the mind they never quit it. More
  than 100,000 copies of this work have been sold.&mdash;W. C.</p>

  <p class="sp3">COBBETT'S FRENCH GRAMMAR (<i>Price</i> 5<i>s.</i>); or, <i>Plain Instructions for
  the Learning of French</i>.&mdash;This book has had, and has, a very great effect in the producing
  of its object. More young men have, I dare say, learned French from it than from all the other
  books that have been published in English for the last fifty years. It is like the former, a book
  of <i>principles</i>, clearly laid down. I had this great advantage too, that I had learnt French
  <i>without a master.</i> I had grubbed it out, bit by bit, and knew well how to remove <i>all the
  difficulties</i>; I remembered what it was that had <i>puzzled</i> and <i>retarded</i> me; and I
  have taken care, in this, my Grammar, to prevent the reader from experiencing that which, in this
  respect, I experienced myself. This Grammar, as well as the former, is kept out of <i>schools</i>
  owing to the fear that the masters and mistresses have of being looked upon as <span
  class="sc">Cobbettites</span>. So much the worse for the children of the stupid brutes who are the
  cause of this fear, which <i>sensible</i> people laugh at, and avail themselves of the advantages
  tendered to them in the books. Teaching French in <i>English Schools</i> is, generally, mere
  delusion; and as to teaching the <i>pronunciation</i> by <i>rules</i>, it is the grossest of all
  human absurdities. My knowledge of French was so complete thirty-seven years ago, that the very
  first thing in the shape of a book that I wrote for the press, was a Grammar to <i>teach</i> the
  Frenchmen English; and, of course, it was <i>written in French.</i> I must know all about these
  two languages; and must be able to give advice to young people on the subject: their time is
  precious; and I advise them not to waste it upon what are called <i>lessons</i> from masters and
  mistresses. To learn the pronunciation, there is no way but that of <i>hearing</i> those, and
  <i>speaking</i> with those, who speak the language well. My Grammar will do the rest.&mdash;W.

  <p>This book was suggested to me by my own frequent want of the information which it contains; a
  suggestion which, if every compiler did but wait to feel before he puts his shears to work, would
  spare the world many a voluminous and useless book. I am constantly receiving letters out of the
  country, the writers living in obscure places, but who seldom think of giving more than the
  <i>name</i> of the place that they write from; and thus have I been often puzzled to death to find
  out even the <i>county</i> in which it is before I could return an answer. I one day determined,
  therefore, for my own convenience, to have a list made out of <i>every parish</i> in the kingdom;
  but this being done, I found that I had still <i>townships</i> and <i>hamlets</i> to add in order
  to make my list complete; and when I had got the work only half done, I found it a book; and that,
  with the addition of bearing, and population, and distance from the next market town, or if a
  market town, from London, it will be a really useful <i>Geographical Dictionary.</i> It is a work
  which the learned would call <i>sui generis</i>; it prompted itself into life, and it has grown in
  my hands: but I will here insert the whole of the title-page, for that contains a full description
  of the book. It is a thick octavo volume, <i>Price</i> 12<i>s.</i>&mdash;W. C.</p>

  <p>COBBETT'S COTTAGE ECONOMY (<i>Price</i> 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>); containing information relative
  to the brewing of Beer, making of Bread, keeping of Cows, Pigs, Bees, Ewes, Goats, Poultry, and
  Rabbits, and relative to other matters deemed useful in the conducting of the Affairs of a
  Labourer's Family; to which are added, instructions relative to the selecting, the cutting and
  bleaching of the Plants of English Grass and Grain, for the purpose of making Hats and Bonnets;
  and also instructions for erecting and using Ice-houses, after the Virginian manner. In my own
  estimation, the book that stands first is the <span class="sc">Poor Man's Friend</span>; and the
  one that stands next is this <span class="sc">Cottage Economy</span>; and beyond all description
  is the pleasure I derive from reflecting on the number of happy families that this little book
  must have made. I dined in company with a lady in Worcestershire, who desired to see me on account
  of this book; and she told me that until she read it she knew nothing at all about these two great
  matters, the making of bread and of beer; but that from the moment she read the book, she began to
  teach her servants, and that the benefits were very great. But, to the labouring people, there are
  the arguments in favour of good conduct, sobriety, frugality, industry, all the domestic virtues;
  here are the reasons for all these; and it must be a real devil in human shape who does not
  applaud the man who could sit down to write this book, a copy of which every <i>parson</i> ought,
  upon pain of loss of ears, to present to every girl that he marries, rich or poor.&mdash;W. C.</p>

  <p>"Differing as I do from Mr. Cobbett in his politics, I must say that he has been of great use
  to the poor. This 'Cottage Economy' gives them hints and advice which have, and continue to be, of
  the greatest service to them; it contains a little mine of wealth, of which the poor may reap the
  advantage; for no one understands the character of the English labourer better than Mr. Cobbett.
  Since writing the above, Mr. Cobbett is no more; his 'Cottage Economy' should be considered as his
  legacy to the poor."&mdash;<span class="sc">Jesse's Gleanings.</span> Vol. 2. p. 358.</p>

  <p>"Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to Cobbett's political writings, and as to his
  peculiar views and prejudices, there cannot be a doubt that all his works on domestic management,
  on rural affairs, and on the use of language, are marked by strong sense, and by great clearness
  of thought and precision of language. His power of conveying instruction is, indeed, almost
  unequalled; he seems rather to woo the reader to learn than to affect the teacher; he travels with
  his pupil over the field of knowledge upon which he is engaged, never seeming to forget the steps
  by which he himself learned. He assumes that nothing is known, and no point is too minute for the
  most careful investigation. Above all, the pure mother English in which his instructions are
  conveyed, makes him a double teacher; for whilst the reader is ostensibly receiving instruction on
  some subject of rural economy, he is at the same time insensibly imbibing a taste for good sound
  Saxon English&mdash;the very type of the substantial matters whereof his instructor delights to
  discourse. Most of Cobbett's works on rural and domestic economy, though written for the
  industrious and middle classes of this country, are admirably adapted to the use of settlers in
  new countries. For an old and thickly-peopled country like England, perhaps Cobbett carried his
  notion of doing everything at home a little too far; but in a new country, where a man is at times
  compelled to turn his hand to everything, it is really well to know how everything connected with
  rural economy should be done, and we really know of no works whence this extended knowledge can be
  acquired so readily as from those of Cobbett. He understood all the operations incidental to the
  successful pursuit of husbandry, and his very prejudice of surrounding the farm with a wall of
  brass, and having every resource within, prompted him to write on rural affairs with
  completeness.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"The little half-crown book, which we now introduce to our readers, contains a mine
  of most valuable instruction, every line of which is as useful to the colonist as to those for
  whom it was written. We have just read it through, from the title to the imprint, with especial
  regard to the wants of the colonists, and we do not believe there is a single sentence of the
  instructional portion that need be rejected. The treatise on brewing and making bread are
  particularly applicable to New Zealand. We observe by the published list of prices, that while
  flour was there selling at a moderate price, bread was enormously high. There is nobody to blame
  for this; it arises simply out of the high rate of retail profit which prevails in new countries,
  and we know no reason why bakers should be expected to keep shop for less remuneration than other
  tradesmen. The remedy then is, not to abuse the baker, but to bake at home. How this is to be
  accomplished Cobbett here points out. Some idea of the saving by means of home baking in our
  colonies, where retail profits are high, may be gleaned from the great difference between the
  price of flour and that of bread at Wellington, at the same date. When flour was selling at
  20<i>l</i>. per ton, the bakers of Wellington were charging 1s. 8d. for the 4lb. loaf. Now, one
  cwt. of flour would make from 126lb. to 134lb of bread, that is, on an average, 32 loaves of 4lb.
  each. These would cost:&mdash;flour 20s, yeast 1s, salt 6d, with fuel 1s&mdash;together 22s 6d, or
  something under 9d per 4lb loaf. Here, then, would be an enormous saving to the settler's family
  by means of home bread making:&mdash;is not Cobbett right when he deprecates the idea of the farm
  labourer going to the baker's shop? and, if he be right in England, where the baker works for a
  small profit, his recommendation has ten times the force when applied to a colony like New
  Zealand. Let it be remembered also, that, by home-baking, the quality of the bread is guaranteed.
  Doubtless, honest bakers do exist; but if there be only a few who occasionally make use potatoes,
  and other materials less nourishing than wheat, surely the guarantee is worth something where
  soundness of muscle and sinew is of so much importance. Earnestly, then, do we recommend every New
  Zealand emigrant to purchase this little book, and make himself master of all it
  contains."&mdash;<span class="sc">New Zealand Journal</span>, 8th January, 1842.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"If the emigrant require elementary works on any subject of domestic
  management&mdash;extending the term domestic matters outside as well as inside of the
  house&mdash;it is not too much to say that the name of Cobbett may be considered a guarantee that
  he will find the subject treated with completeness, and in a style at once simple and attractive.
  Whilst we say this, the reader must not be alarmed lest we design to thrust all Cobbett's
  political views down his throat. Like all strong-passioned men he was not unfrequently
  inconsistent; on subjects of social and politico-economical science especially, he was as often
  unsound as sound; he frequently threw himself into the stream of popular prejudice, not only
  closing his mind to the reasonings of others, but scarcely daring to use his own strong powers
  lest he should be convinced against his previous determination. But on the subjects embraced by
  the Cottage Economy, and others of a like character, Cobbett was and is a trustworthy instructor,
  and we hesitate not to say that the emigrant who will follow his instructions will, in a few
  years, find himself a wiser, a wealthier, a better, and, above all, a happier man, in consequence
  of having done so. The English Housekeeper is by Miss Cobbett, and bears evident marks of the
  Cobbett school of domestic management. The same wholesome healthy tone&mdash;the same simplicity
  of taste pervades all its recommendations; and even in the good sound mother-English in which it
  is written we recognise the pure source whence it sprung. It cannot be expected that we should
  examine all the receipts and pronounce our opinion on their merits. To confess the truth, we are
  not competent to the task. The reader, therefore, must be content with the information that this
  part of the work appears to be very amply stored with the good things of this world, and, what is
  more to the purpose, a very cursory glance has convinced us that the colonist family might avail
  themselves of the greater part of this division of the book with advantage and profit. The truly
  valuable portions of the work are those which relate to domestic management. We have not space to
  go into particulars, and extracts would scarcely serve any good purpose. As one might expect from
  a Cobbett, the chapter devoted to the Cellar contains some excellent directions for the making of
  British wines, many of which will be found applicable to New Zealand and the Australian Colonies,
  and afford a cheap luxury to colonist's family. Here also we have some useful directions brewing,
  in addition to the instructions given in the Cottage Economy. Cookery for the Sick, and Cookery
  for the Poor, are two valuable chapters; and it is an additional recommendation that many of the
  articles under these heads may easily be made at sea. In conclusion, we earnestly recommend the
  books to the emigrant's notice. The general instructions may be studied with profit during the
  voyage, and when fairly settled we have no doubt the colonist's wife would insensibly find the
  book constantly in her hand."&mdash;<i>New Zealand Journal</i>, Jan. 22, 1842.</p>

  every young lady who undertakes the management of her domestic affairs, not only for the valuable
  instructions it contains concerning all that relates to the kitchen and cookery, but for the
  sensible advice it offers to females in the most important duties of domestic life. This to us
  most interesting portion of the work is written in the plain, forcible, and convincing style of
  the author's late father. There is the same wholesome and practical advice put forward in that
  easy, familiar way which impresses itself indelibly upon the reader's mind. There are some
  observations upon the mode of educating daughters which should be attentively perused by every
  mother. There is a truth and beauty, and a spirit of kind womanly feeling in the chapter on
  servants. It is a noble vindication of the poor, which ought to be written in letters of gold upon
  the walls of the rich man's chamber. Of the culinary receipts, the directions for managing the
  pantry, larder, store-room, &amp;c., we can speak in terms of unqualified commendation. The
  medical and miscellaneous receipts are numerous and valuable."&mdash;<span class="sc">Sunday
  Times</span>, January 30, 1842.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"If we had seen the <i>twentieth</i> edition on the title of the 'English
  Housekeeper,' instead of the <i>third</i>, we should not have been surprised. We passed our humble
  opinion on the merits of this work upon its first appearance. Now we behold a new and improved
  edition, enlarged, and with numerous indispensible recipes, rendering it one of the most complete
  works of the kind that has come under our criticism; everything as regards housekeeping being laid
  down in a clear, concise style, not only of essential utility to the young housekeeper, but to the
  already experienced practitioner. Miss Cobbett must have devoted years to the production of the
  volume, for turn to what page you will, it abounds with striking and useful, as well as practical
  facts, so admirably arranged, that a very young lady might become, after a few hours' perusal,
  well qualified to discharge the domestic duties of a wife."&mdash;<span class="sc">Blackwood's

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
